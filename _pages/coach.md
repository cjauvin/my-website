I provide private lessons or services on Emacs, Linux, and Life in
general.  My skills as a coach:

- Patient
- Compassionate
- Thoughtful
- Friendly
- Disciplined
- Adaptable

For more details on my competences, you can check the publications on
my website, such as (i) my videos on philosophy, (ii) my Emacs
tutorials, (iii) the numerous packages I have written and maintain for
Emacs, (iv) my custom working environment on Linux, and (v) lots of
other writings.

## Private lessons

These are done either via video call or email, at your discretion.
The standard is one hour per session.  Lessons can be up to two hours
long, though I recommend the one hour as it helps with knowledge
retention.  Multiple courses can be spread out throughout the week,
depending on what you need.

Some examples of private lessons you may be interested in:

- Help understand the Emacs Lisp programming language and set up a
  personalised Emacs configuration file.
- Customise a Linux working environment centred around a tiling window
  manager.
- Clarify the statements of a manual or technical documentation and
  provide concrete examples.
- Be a talking buddy to aid in the practice of English.  We can
  discuss any subject: what really matters is for you to use the
  language without hesitation.
- Encourage you to be more spontaneous and talk without a script.
- Expound on philosophical themes that have practical applications in
  our everyday life, such as how to deal with self-inhibiting
  thoughts.

Private lessons are always one-on-one.  I will never ask you to be
grouped together with another person nor involve a third party.

## Services

I accept commissions on a case-by-case basis.  I can deliver bespoke
solutions to particular problems in any of the topics I cover.  This
is most likely relevant to Emacs and Linux, though I do not preclude
other themes.  You are encouraged to email me, explaining your
requirements: I will assess them and inform you whether I can produce
the desired results.

## Work hours

I am available every day of the week.  I currently live in Cyprus.
The time zone is that of Europe/Athens.  Contact me and we will
schedule a meeting that suits both parties.

## Pricing

- Private lessons cost 20 EUR per hour.  Students are entitled to the
  discounted price of 15 EUR per hour.  I will not ask for proof if
  you are a student or not: I trust you to be honest.
- Services vary in price depending on their complexity.  We will need
  to evaluate the requirements.  Expect the cost to range between 20
  to 60 EUR per hour, which we will agree to in advance together with
  an estimate of the total effort.

## Payments

You are expected to pay **after the private lesson is delivered**.
You never have to do it in advance, unless you absolutely want to.
The same is true for common services, though I might ask for 1/3
advance payment in case of a complex/difficult project.

The payment methods are as follows:

1. **GitHub Sponsors** one-time donation.  GitHub does not charge
   extra fees and you can make one-off payments of an arbitrary value
   even though the main method is for small recurring/monthly
   contributions: <https://github.com/sponsors/protesilaos>.

2. Send a payment **via PayPal**: <https://www.paypal.me/protesilaos>.
   PayPal takes a small percentage to process the transaction.

3. Use a **direct bank transfer** via the [International Bank Account
   Number (IBAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number).
   My IBAN is `CY23 0090 0520 0005 2010 0144 6252`.  Make sure you are
   specifying my full name, namely, `Protesilaos Stavrou`, and are
   using the Euro (EUR) currency.  Though you most likely do not need
   this, the BIC SWIFT code of my bank's branch is `ABKLCY2N`.
   Depending on your country, bank transfers may either be the
   cheapest option or the most expensive one, so please double-check.

## Prospective students

I accept everyone regardless of their cultural background, sexual
orientation, lifestyle choices, et cetera.  Due to the nature of the
topics I cover, I expect students to be adults.  In principle, I can
tutor younger people as well, provided I receive the express
permission of their guardian and after I assess the situation.

## Privacy policy

I will not share your details with anyone nor publicise any
potentially personally identifying information.  You are welcome to
use a pseudonym.  If/when we do a video call, you are free to not show
your face.

## Preference for libre software

I want us to rely on free software as much as possible.  This includes
freedom-respecting file formats like `.txt`, `.md`, `.org`, as well as
video call software like Jitsi or Jami:

- <https://meet.jit.si/>
- <https://jami.net/>

I understand that sometimes we have to make compromises.  Please let
me know about the specifics of your case and I will adapt accordingly.

## Contact me
