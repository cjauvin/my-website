If you want to make a donation, use any of the following platforms:

* GitHub <https://github.com/sponsors/protesilaos>
* Liberapay <https://liberapay.com/protesilaos/>
* PayPal <https://www.paypal.me/protesilaos>

Below is the text I use on the GitHub and Liberpay links (I keep it here
to edit and copy-paste more easily).

All my publications are free/libre and I shall never put anything
behind a paywall.  This also means that donations will not give you
any special perks or some kind of privilege.

I am a philosopher.  My website is a de facto resource for
self-learning.  I contribute to GNU Emacs and free software in a
number of ways, while I also write or talk about non-software-related
issues.  Below is an overview for those who are not familiar with my
work.

## Packages for GNU Emacs

I develop and maintain a growing number of packages for Emacs.  You
can find the full list here: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/>.  Among
them is the `modus-themes` (`modus-operandi` and `modus-vivendi`
themes) which is built into Emacs version 28 or higher, and the
increasingly popular `denote` note-taking system.

Every package comes with comprehensive documentation and sample code
on how to use it and/or configure it further.  The change logs I
publish also cover all the relevant information.

On 2022-03-19 the Free Software Foundation awarded me the _2021 Award
for Outstanding New Free Software Contributor_.  I have since received
the physical item.  Pictures and video update:

## Videos on Emacs and related philosophy

I have published tens of video tutorials on various aspects of Emacs.
Everything is available on my website's coding blog section:
<https://protesilaos.com/codelog/>.  Or check the "code casts"
subsection which only includes videos:
<https://protesilaos.com/code-casts/>.

I also talk about software freedom and concomitant concepts.  Some
examples of those:

+ [Why Emacs itself is my “favourite Emacs
  package”](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2020-10-21-emacs-favourite-package/)
  (2020-10-21).
+ [Moral lessons from free software and GNU
  Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-04-16-emacs-moral-lessons/)
  (2021-04-16).
+ [Live stream: Emacs as a 'second brain' and
  mindfulness](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-08-31-emacs-second-brain-mindfulness/)
  (2021-08-31).
+ [Live stream: Emacs and the Unix
  philosophy](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-09-22-live-stream-emacs-unix/)
  (2021-09-22).
+ [EmacsConf 2021: How Emacs made me appreciate software
  freedom](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-12-21-emacsconf2021-freedom/)
  (published on 2021-12-21---the actual event was on November 27-28,
  2021).
+ [LibrePlanet 2022: Living in freedom with GNU
  Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-03-22-libreplanet-emacs-living-freedom/)
  (published on 2022-03-22---the actual event was on March 19-20,
  2022).

## Philosophy and other writings

I am a prolific writer on abstract matters of philosophy but also on
more practical life issues.  My overall approach to philosophy is that
(i) it must consist of insights that one can live by and (ii) the
language used to communicate those should not be an impediment to
their understanding.  Put differently, I do not write for an academic
audience, do not rely on jargon, do not introduce alien concepts
without explaining them in context, and do not try to impress or
confuse the reader by using hyperbole, paradoxes, intentionally
misleading expressions, or other techniques of rhetoric.

Check the section of my website on books and standalone essays:
<https://protesilaos.com/books/>.  There also are lots of video
presentations there, including ones where I walk in nature and expound
on some philosophical theme.

Sometimes I publish excerpts of comments I make via email or other
media.  Those are always shared with the express permission of my
correspondent.  The topics are primarily philosophical though are
directly linked to practical scenaria.  If you want to ask me such
questions, feel welcome to do so:
<https://protesilaos.com/commentary/>.

I also provide philosophical commentary on works of art, typically
Greek songs whose lyrics I translate.  You can find those in the
"interpretations" section of my website:
<https://protesilaos.com/interpretations>.

Everything I have ever written on my website since 2011 when I got
started is available under copyleft terms: <https://protesilaos.com>.
