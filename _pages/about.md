## Profile

In my teens I was a semi-professional football (soccer) player and, at
times, an assistant to a land surveyor and a motorcycle mechanic.

During my university years I was employed as a bartender, construction
worker, receptionist, waiter, etc.

After my studies in mid-2011 and up until ~2016 I got involved in
politics-related fields (parliamentary assistant at the European
Parliament, independent researcher and external contractor, etc.), with
a specialisation in the European Union's Economic and Monetary Union.

Now I am nominally committed to agricultural activities in a remote
mountainous region in Cyprus, though the prevailing conditions (the
pandemic, persistent economic recession...) mean that I am oscillating
between states of under- and un- employment.

Those granted, I am just a philosopher.  I spend much of my time doing
philosophy, whether that is by thinking or writing.  I also program my
custom computing environment and generally try to do things my way for
their inherent recreational or educational value.

Sometimes I blend programming with philosophy, as made evident by such
questions as the one that populates my GitLab/GitHub profile's
description:

> At what point does a tinkerer become a programmer, provided no formal
> background in the latter?

Or in some of the videos I make which are nominally about a text editor
but I actually talk philosophy, such as:

+ [Why Emacs itself is my “favourite Emacs
  package”](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2020-10-21-emacs-favourite-package/)
  (2020-10-21).
+ [Moral lessons from free software and GNU
  Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-04-16-emacs-moral-lessons/)
  (2021-04-16).
+ [Live stream: Emacs as a 'second brain' and
  mindfulness](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-08-31-emacs-second-brain-mindfulness/)
  (2021-08-31).
+ [Live stream: Emacs and the Unix
  philosophy](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-09-22-live-stream-emacs-unix/)
  (2021-09-22).
+ [EmacsConf 2021: How Emacs made me appreciate software
  freedom](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-12-21-emacsconf2021-freedom/)
  (published on 2021-12-21---the actual event was on November 27-28, 2021).
+ [LibrePlanet 2022: Living in freedom with GNU
  Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-03-22-libreplanet-emacs-living-freedom/)
  (published on 2022-03-22---the actual event was on March 19-20,
  2022).

In a manner of speaking, I just talk to programmers about philosophy and
to philosophers about programming.  Another relevant introduction is [My
'Brown University Interviews' on Emacs and
life](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-10-29-interview-brown-uni-mag-emacs-life/)
(2021-10-29).  A comprehensive [interview with InfoQ China on Emacs and
life](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-04-10-interview-infoq-china-emacs-life/)
may also prove useful (2022-04-10).

On 2022-03-19 the Free Software Foundation awarded me the _2021 Award
for Outstanding New Free Software Contributor_.  [Check the
announcement](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-03-22-libreplanet-fsf-award/),
which includes the video I prepared, the text of what I said, and a link
to the FSF's press release about these awards.

I also talk or write about philosophy without any reference to free
software or related.  Refer to my website's section on [books and
standalone essays](https://protesilaos.com/books).

For a more personal take, check [Comment on whether I have
ASD](https://protesilaos.com/commentary/2022-06-01-asd/).  It is part of
my website's "commentary" section, which covers general life issues.
There probably are other hints about me in that section, though this one
is straightforward.

## protesilaos.com

This website has been online since 2011.  It contains more than 1000
entries on a wide range of topics, all of which are available under the
appropriate _copyleft_ terms that ensure end user freedom—see the
[license and resources](https://protesilaos.com/license/) page.  Read,
learn, think, and reach your own conclusions.

The report on [Ten years of
protesilaos.com](https://protesilaos.com/news/2021-02-08-website-ten-years/)
(2021-02-08) might also be of interest, though note that I have since
picked up pace and publish even more than before.

What I wrote in the past may not represent my current views.  I review,
change, refine my beliefs as part of a life of research and reflection.
If you are looking for consistency, a dogma to follow, a narcissist to
idolise, you need to look elsewhere.  It is important to understand that
_you should not follow me_, for I am not going anywhere in particular.
