Designed two bespoke themes for users with red-green colour deficiency
or blindness (deuteranopia).  They rely on blue and yellow hues.  Their
names are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>ef-deuteranopia-dark</code></li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Introduced the variable <code>ef-themes-mixed-fonts</code>.  When it is set to a
non-nil (<code>t</code>) value, it makes spacing-sensitive elements use a
monospaced font.  For example, Org tables and code blocks will always
look properly aligned.  This is useful for those who either use a
proportionately spaced font as their default or enable the built-in
<code>variable-pitch-mode</code>.</li>

<li>Implemented the variable <code>ef-themes-variable-pitch-ui</code>.  When it is
set to a non-nil (<code>t</code>) value, it renders the mode-line, tab-bar-mode,
and tab-line-mode in a proportionately spaced font.</li>
</ul>

<p>
User options must be set before the theme is loaded.  If an option
changes, its value will be read upon a theme re-load.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:582dea7b-454a-4500-871b-4ec45e875274">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fixed the scaling of current line of <code>display-line-numbers-mode</code> when
<code>text-scale-adjust</code> was invoked.  Basically I forgot to include the
<code>line-number</code> face, while all others were covered.  Thanks to Anthony
Chavez for the feedback in issue 7 over at the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/7">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/7</a>.</li>

<li>Covered all faces that define group titles in completion contexts.
These are headings which are used by various commands, such as
<code>consult-buffer</code>, <code>consult-imenu</code>, and <code>consult-grep</code>.  As they denote
a group name, we apply the <code>name</code> colour mapping (the hue differs for
each theme).  And since they are titles, we inherit from <code>bold</code> to
make them look like headings.  Thanks to Summer Emacs for the feedback
which amounted to:

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Treating group titles as headings.</li>
<li>Using a more consistent colour theme-wide.</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Revised the <code>compilation-info</code> face from a colour-coded "success" face
to a value that is consistent with the semantics of its application in
file names or related (as seen in the emacs.git repository).  For
example, file names in Grep or Xref buffers will now look like they
belong to the theme, whereas before they were predominantly green,
even when that did not make sense.  This point is connected to the
above, such as in workflows that go from the minibuffer to a Grep
buffer (e.g. with the use of the <code>embark</code> package).</li>

<li>Toned down the vertical border between windows by explicitly
supporting the <code>vertical-border</code> face.  The previous design would use
the main foreground which generally led to a disproportionately
intense result.</li>

<li><p>
Adjusted all spacing-sensitive faces to accommodate the user option
<code>ef-themes-mixed-fonts</code>, as noted above.  Also thanks to Christopher
League for spotting that I had missed the <code>line-number</code> face and for
providing the relevant patch (I do the same in the <code>modus-themes</code>):
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/%3C871qt2x4wi.fsf%40nita.mail-host-address-is-not-set%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/%3C871qt2x4wi.fsf%40nita.mail-host-address-is-not-set%3E</a>
</p>

<p>
The patch is well below the ~15 line threshold and thus does not
require copyright assignment to the Free Software Foundation.
</p></li>

<li>Enforced mono spacing for the <code>org-indent</code> face.  This is essential
for <code>org-indent-mode</code> to align entries correctly.  Thanks to Steve
Molitor for reporting this in the issue 9 over at the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/9">https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/9</a>.  Steve tested a
sample file with <code>modus-vivendi</code> and got the desired results.  It
reminded me how I handle this face in the <code>modus-themes</code>.</li>

<li>Added explicit support for the <code>bold</code> and <code>italic</code> faces.  The default
definition of <code>italic</code> has conditionality which we do not want, such
as drawing an underline if the font does not have italics (e.g. Fira
Code).  Styling it at the theme level prevents that from happening:
the font without italics will simply use the upright/roman glyphs.
Adding <code>bold</code> is just for clarity.  Its default definition is fine.</li>

<li>Made the tabs of the built-in <code>tab-bar-mode</code> and <code>tab-line-mode</code> stand
out more.  The difference between the current tab and the rest was too
subtle.  Depending on the lighting conditions, their respective
backgrounds were indistinguishable.  Thanks to Summer Emacs for
reporting this issue and for helping me decide on the final design.</li>

<li>Applied tinted backgrounds to values and arguments in transient.el
buffers (e.g. Magit).  They now stand out better.</li>

<li><p>
Answered the Frequently Asked Question of letting Org tags inherit the
foreground colour of the heading they belong to.  The gist (though
note that the entry also mentions the option for the non-alignment of
tags):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Upstream Org defines tags in headings to have the same color as the rest
of the heading's text.  However, tags are a distinct component of the
heading as noted in the doc string of the <code>org-get-heading</code> function.
Tags also are functionally different than the ordinary text of the
heading: they are a clickable link/button.  It thus is a matter of
usability to render this distinction clear at the visual level: I do not
agree with upstream Org's design decision.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>Addressed another Frequently Asked Question on whether we can have
Ef-style themes inspired by the Nord or Zenburn themes.  The short
version is that this is technically difficult and undesirable.  Each
palette in the Ef themes collection is original and is designed around
the normative and aesthetic principles of this project.</li>

<li>Wrote an entire section on Do-It-Yourself customisations.  These
generally are for advanced users, though the manual provides concrete
examples of using the <code>ef-themes-with-colors</code> macro in tandem with the
<code>ef-themes-post-load-hook</code>.</li>

<li><p>
Elaborated on the list of packages that I will most likely NOT support
in the Ef themes.  The reasons vary though.  Quote:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
These are difficult to support due to their (i) incompatibility with
the design of the <code>ef-themes</code>, (ii) complexity or multiple points of
entry, (iii) external dependencies, (iv) existence of better
alternatives in my opinion, or (v) inconsiderate use of color
out-of-the-box and implicit unwillingness to be good Emacs citizens
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If a certain package does not look right, then it is not supported
(yet).

<li>Recalibrated diff colours or the context of diff buffers, especially
in Magit, to improve usability.</li>

<li>Adjusted or otherwise tweaked the hues that apply to key bindings and
links in order to reinforce the stylistic consistency of each theme.</li>

<li>Introduced a yellow-tinted background which is used in various
contexts that (i) should be styled with a coloured background but (ii)
should not be colour-coded as either red or green/blue.</li>

<li>Made the <code>ef-themes-with-colors</code> macro always reify the current Ef
theme's palette.  This macro is for advanced users.  Its utility is
documented in the themes' manual.</li>

<li>Fixed how themes become "known" at startup.  Before, they were not
registered correctly for immediate use with the <code>ef-themes-select</code>

6 over at the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/6">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/6</a>.</li>

<li>Tweaked some face attributes to work with Emacs 27.</li>

<li>Tinkered with the colour mapping or precise values of practically all
the themes.  Better consult the Git log for the minutiae.  I think the
identity of each theme is largely defined, though there may still be
tweaks to be done here and there until we eventually reach version

Revised the minimum Emacs version of the <code>ef-themes</code> package.  It now
depends on Emacs 27.1 instead of Emacs 28.1.  Relevant internal
adjustments were made, some of which are courtesy of Philip
Kaludercic: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/patches/34787">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/patches/34787</a>.
</p>

<p>
[ Philip has assigned copyright to the Free Software Foundation.  This
  is necessary for all non-trivial patches. ]
</p></li>

<li>Added two new themes to the collection which are designed for users
with red-green colour deficiency/blindness (deuteranopia).  In simple
terms, their effective palette consists of blue, yellow, and the base
tones.  The themes are named descriptively: <code>ef-deuteranopia-dark</code> and
<code>ef-deuteranopia-light</code>.  Announcement with screenshots:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-08-19-ef-themes-deuteranopia/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-08-19-ef-themes-deuteranopia/</a>.</li>

<li>Reconsidered the principle of what kind of user options are
acceptable.  Those which affect colours directly will never be a part
of the project.  Others are subject to consideration with a preference
for simplicity.  Detailed documentation to do-it-yourself will still
be preferred over user options.</li>

<li><p>
Implemented the <code>ef-themes-headings</code> user option which provides the
mechanism to change the weight and height of each heading level, as
well as set it to <code>variable-pitch</code> (i.e. a proportionately spaced
font).  The doc string of that variable or the relevant entry in the
manual explain the particularities and provided code samples.
</p>

<p>
To accommodate this variable, the default style of all headings has
been revised to remove the added height they once had.  Users who
preferred the previous style must add the following to their
configuration BEFORE the code that actually loads the theme (e.g. a
<code>load-theme</code> call):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  ;; Restore height of each heading level to its previous value.
  (setq ef-themes-headings
        '((0 . (1.9))
          (1 . (1.8))
          (2 . (1.7))
          (3 . (1.6))
          (4 . (1.5))
          (5 . (1.4))
          (6 . (1.3))
          (7 . (1.2))
          (t . (1.1))))

  ;; First set the above configuration, then load the theme (changes to
  ;; user options require a theme re-load).
  (load-theme 'ef-summer :no-confirm)
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
Introduced the command <code>ef-themes-toggle</code> and the companion user
option <code>ef-themes-to-toggle</code>.  To use the command, one must first set
their two preferred Ef themes, such as with this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (setq ef-themes-to-toggle '(ef-summer ef-winter))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The names of all the themes are included in the <code>ef-themes-collection</code>
variable.  Though recall that the commands <code>ef-themes-select</code> and
<code>ef-themes-load-random</code> still use the entire collection (read their
doc strings or consult the manual).
</p></li>

<li>Fixed how themes are made available at startup.  Before, there was a
mistake to how items were registered as "known" and were thus not
recognised by our commands, even though the standard <code>load-theme</code>
worked as expected.  Thanks to Iris Garcia for reporting the problem
in issue 2 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/2">https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/2</a>.  It was
propagated to users as version 0.2.1 of the <code>ef-themes</code>.</li>

<li><p>
Added support for these packages:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>chart</li>
<li>doom-modeline (tentative)</li>
<li>info</li>
<li>org-habit</li>
<li>rcirc</li>
<li>smerge</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thanks to Spike-Leung for reminding me about <code>org-habit</code> in issue 5
over at the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/5">https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/5</a>.
</p>

<p>
[ Remember that if a package looks awfully out of place, it is not
  support (yet). ]
</p></li>

<li><p>
Expanded and/or clarified the manual, including an answer to the
question of what "Ef" means:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Ef" is a Greek word (ευ), commonly used as a prefix to denote that
something is good, nice, and/or easy.  For example, eftopia (ευτοπία)
is the opposite of dystopia (δυστοπία): a good place as opposed to a
bad place.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>Helped Adam Sherwood figure out why zsh-autosuggestions did not look
right.  In short: this has nothing to do with Emacs.  Try to avoid
termcolor{0,7,8,15} as a default.  Prefer the remaining nominal accent
colours, as every theme is more likely to work with those, whereas,
say, termcolor0 ("black") will not be legible with dark themes.  This
was done in issue 3 on the GitHub mirror:

<li>Recalibrated lots of colour values and mappings across several themes.
The changes are small and help with the internal consistency of each
theme.  Consult the Git commit log for the minutiae.</li>

<li>The internal faces for headings are now done with a <code>dotimes</code> call on
<code>custom-declare-face</code> instead of a bespoke macro.  Thanks to Philip

<li>Applied <code>file-equal-p</code> for the registration of the themes in the
relevant path.  Doing so is generally more resilient than <code>equal</code> and
might avoid an unexpected edge case in the future.  Thanks to Philip

<li>Opted for <code>{if,when}-let*</code> over <code>{if,when}-let</code>.  The former do not
support the obsolete single-binding syntax, and make clear that both
macros operate more like <code>let*</code> than <code>let</code> by evaluating and binding
variables sequentially.  Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for the patch:

Thanks to user Summer Emacs whose feedback helped define the identity of
the <code>ef-summer</code> theme.  Summer's comments pertained to the need to
increase the occurence of yellow as the theme used to be predominantly
magenta and purple.  I thus implemented the revised colour mapping and
made the relevant adjustments.  Without Summer's comments, <code>ef-summer</code>
wouldn't have been as pretty.

No release notes were produced at the time.  This version included
various stylistic refinements and added commands for (i) loading a theme
and (ii) previewing a theme's colour palette.

<p>
The commands which load a theme call the <code>ef-themes-post-load-hook</code>.
