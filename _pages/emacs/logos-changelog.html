All functions or variables referenced herein have documentation strings
and are also documented in the manual.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Implemented the user option <code>logos-olivetti</code> which is a buffer-local
variable that is read when <code>logos-focus-mode</code> is enabled.  This
provides the glue code to integrate Logos with <code>olivetti</code>.  Olivetti
is a package by Paul W. Rankin which centres the contents of the
buffer in its window.</li>

<li>Removed the do-it-yourself snippet that was present in the manual for
piecing together Logos and Olivetti.  The documentation has been
updated accordingly.  Users who followed the old method are advised to
review their configurations.</li>

<li>Abstracted the state handling of the variables and modes that are
affected by <code>logos-focus-mode</code>, based on feedback by Daniel Mendler.
This improves how the code is written and makes it easier to extend
it.</li>

<li>Introduced the user options <code>logos-indicate-buffer-boundaries</code> and
<code>logos-buffer-read-only</code>.  Both are buffer-local and both take effect
when <code>logos-focus-mode</code> is enabled.  The former controls the
<code>indicate-buffer-boundaries</code> while the latter determines whether the
buffer should be put in a read-only mode.</li>

<li>Changed how user options are declared as buffer-local, by using the
appropriate keyword of <code>defcustom</code>.  Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for
the patch, which was sent via email.</li>

<li>Wrote a node entry on how to write a regular expression that targets
only specific Org heading levels.  This pertains to user options
<code>logos-outlines-are-pages</code> and <code>logos-outline-regexp-alist</code>.</li>

<li>Added keywords to the package metadata to help its discoverability.</li>

<li>Fixed typo in a function's doc string.  Thanks to Remco van 't Veer

In the beginning, there was <code>prot-logos.el</code>.  A file that pieced
together some code and configurations I had for presentations (part of
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>).  On 2022-03-02 I decided to take the code out of my
personal setup and turn it into a general purpose package.
</p>

<p>
It occured to me that "logos" is a nice word though it might be a bit
dull for an Emacs package, so I coined the backcronyms "<sup>L</sup> Only
Generates Ostensible Slides" and "Logos Optionally Garners Outline
Sections", which hopefully describe what this is all about.

<p>
Read the manual for the technicalities.
