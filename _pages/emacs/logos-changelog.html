<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:4599c0ac-a01d-4045-be2d-b1c45c92ae39">
<p>
It is now called <code>logos-focus-mode-hook</code> to conform with the
conventions surrounding Emacs Lisp packaging.  The old name is
deprecated and will be removed in the future.  The relevant warnings
are in place to inform users of the change.
</p>

<p>
The <code>logos-focus-mode-extra-functions</code> had the unfortunate connotation
of being an irregular hook, i.e. one that runs with arguments.
Whereas this one is a regular hook that passes no arguments to the
functions it calls.  Quoting from the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If the hook variable’s name does not end with ‘-hook’, that indicates
it is probably an “abnormal hook”.  These differ from normal hooks in
two ways: they can be called with one or more arguments, and their
return values can be used in some way.  The hook’s documentation says
how the functions are called and how their return values are used.  Any
functions added to an abnormal hook must follow the hook’s calling
convention.  By convention, abnormal hook names end in ‘-functions’.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To read the manual, evaluate this inside of Emacs:

<h3 id="h:d1677f40-7392-4433-9a52-a87edd97eb4f">The <code>logos-page-delimiter</code> variable/function is now public</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:d1677f40-7392-4433-9a52-a87edd97eb4f">
<p>
Renaming the <code>logos-page-delimiter</code> function and variable is necessary
as both can safely be included in user-defined code.
</p>

<p>
In the context of Elisp packaging, a "private" symbol is denoted by a
double dash in its name.  Such code is intended for internal use: it
may be redefined or altogether removed without further notice.
Whereas a "public" symbol comes with the implicit guarantee that the
developer will take good care to preserve its behaviour and/or
document any breaking changes.

This concerns <code>logos--mode</code>, hereby renamed to <code>logos-set-mode-arg</code>,
and <code>logos--set</code>, which is now called <code>logos-set-buffer-local-value</code>.

The intent is to make the code public as well as to better describe
what it does already at the naming level.

As always, the relevant arrangements are in place to notify users of
the change.

<p>
The project has a <code>README.org</code> file which contains the project's
documentation and is exported to the Info page format.  A new
<code>README.md</code> is supplied as well to provide the basics of what <code>logos</code>
is, link to its video demo, and further resources.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Dave Abrahams for asking me to put a video demo in the
README.  This inspired me to update this repository to be in the style
of the others I also maintain.  Dave's comment was made in issue 12 on
the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/logos/issues/12">https://github.com/protesilaos/logos/issues/12</a>.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Revised the fallback condition of the user option
<code>logos-outline-regexp-alist</code> (it comes into effect when the
<code>logos-outlines-are-pages</code> is non-nil).
</p>

<p>
The previous value did not account for the buffer-local values of
<code>outline-regexp</code> or <code>page-delimiter</code>, nor did it adapt to any
changes in their respective values.  Instead, it would capture
whatever the value was at the time of the symbol's declaration.
</p>

<p>
We remove the <code>t</code> condition altogether and instead handle the
fallback value internally.  Logos will return the current
buffer-local value of <code>outline-regexp</code> or <code>page-delimiter</code>, in this
order of priority.
</p>

<p>
Put simply, this has the same intent as before, but works properly.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Introduced a check to guard against a void <code>outline-regexp</code>.  The
previous value would cause a problem if the <code>outline-regexp</code> had not
been set yet.  In a typical Emacs session, even on 'emacs -Q', the
<code>outline-regexp</code> is set in the scratch buffer, so we have a valid
value at the outset.  However, when the user changes the
<code>initial-buffer-choice</code> or opens Emacs directly for a given file,
the <code>outline-regexp</code> can be void.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Xiaoduan for informing me about this error and for testing
my code on how to fix it.  This was done via a private channel and
is shared with permission.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Implemented the user option <code>logos-hide-cursor</code>.  It hides the
cursor when <code>logos-focus-mode</code> is enabled.  Note that this user
option is always buffer-local.  Use <code>setq-default</code> to set its
default global value (same as with other user options that apply to
<code>logos-focus-mode</code> (read the manual)).
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Marcel Ventosa for suggesting the idea of hiding the
cursor.  This was done via a private channel and is shared with
permission.
</p></li>

<li>Clarified the documentation of <code>logos-focus-mode-extra-functions</code>.
It is intended for use by those who are prepared to write custom
functions in the spirit of those already used in <code>logos.el</code> to
affect the buffer when <code>logos-focus-mode</code> is enabled.</li>

<li>Added the missing autoload cookie to <code>logos-focus-mode</code>.  This means
that it shows up in the completion candidates of <code>M-x</code> even if the
<code>logos</code> library has not been called via <code>require</code>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-h:189634ab-187a-4e44-9006-1361459150b8">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Introduced the function <code>logos-update-fringe-in-buffers</code>.  This is a
convenience function for those who (i) set the user option
<code>logos-hide-fringe</code> to a non-nil value and (ii) switch themes while
<code>logos-focus-mode</code> is enabled in one or more buffers.  This
convenience function updates the <code>fringe</code> face to be consistent with
the current theme (we technically make the fringe invisible, instead
of outright disabling it, as that would not be desirable).  It needs
to be assigned to a hook that gets called in the post-theme-load
phase.  The <code>modus-themes</code> or the <code>ef-themes</code> (both by me) provide
such a hook.  Otherwise the Logos manual explains how to implement one
for any theme.  Read:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/logos#h:6a254fa0-5706-4032-8a8b-233ffb1f0e6b">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/logos#h:6a254fa0-5706-4032-8a8b-233ffb1f0e6b</a>.</li>

<li><p>
Implemented the <code>logos-focus-mode-map</code>.  This is a keymap that is
active when <code>logos-focus-mode</code> is enabled in the buffer.  One can, for
example, use it to bind the arrow key to page motions, such as
<code>logos-forward-page-dwim</code>.
</p>

<p>
Remember that, by default, pages are delimited with the Control-L
character (<code>^L</code>), though Logos can treat different delimiters as
"page" separators (e.g. Org headings and a horizontal rule of five
hyphens).  Consult the user options <code>logos-outlines-are-pages</code>,
<code>logos-outline-regexp-alist</code>, and check the manual for relevant simple
and more advanced code samples.  My current setup for those:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (setq logos-outlines-are-pages t)
  (setq logos-outline-regexp-alist
        `((emacs-lisp-mode . ,(format "\\(^;;;+ \\|%s\\)" logos--page-delimiter))
          (org-mode . ,(format "\\(^\\*+ +\\|^-\\{5\\}$\\|%s\\)" logos--page-delimiter))
          (markdown-mode . ,(format "\\(^\\#+ +\\|^[*-]\\{5\\}$\\|^\\* \\* \\*$\\|%s\\)" logos--page-delimiter))
          (conf-toml-mode . "^\\[")
          (t . ,(or outline-regexp logos--page-delimiter))))
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
Added the <code>logos-repeat-map</code>.  This is a keymap that gets enabled when
the built-in <code>repeat-mode</code> is active (Emacs 28 or higher).  This means
that page motions, <code>C-x ]</code> and <code>C-x [</code>, can be repeated by following
them up with either <code>]</code> or <code>[</code>.  The repetition stops when another
command is invoked.
</p>

Thanks to Lucy McPhail for the patch:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/logos/patches/34101">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/logos/patches/34101</a>.  The change is
below the ~15 line threshold and thus requires no copyright assignment
to the Free Software Foundation.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Wrote documentation on how to auto-toggle menu and tool bars while
using the <code>logos-focus-mode</code>.  This is complementary to user options
provided by Logos and shows how flexible and extensible the code is.
Thanks to Ypot for raising the question in issue 2 on the GitHub
mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/logos/issues/2">https://github.com/protesilaos/logos/issues/2</a>.
</p>

<p>
[ Never hesitate to ask for help if you want to do something with
  Logos but are not sure how. ]
</p></li>

<li>Specified the <code>:version</code> of all user-facing variables.  This is
helpful while perusing documentation strings in Help buffers, as any
change will be assigned to the given version of Logos.</li>

<li><p>
Clarified the doc string of the <code>logos-variable-pitch</code> user option
with regard to <code>prog-mode</code> buffers.  It now reads thus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When non-nil, use <code>variable-pitch-mode</code> where appropriate.
In programming modes the default font is always used, as that is
assumed to be a monospaced typeface, which is appropriate for
spacing-sensitive text.
</p>

<p>
This is only relevant when <code>logos-focus-mode</code> is enabled.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Documented some user options for the built-in <code>eww</code> which make its
contents behave like the rest of Emacs in terms of the use of fonts
and the filling of paragraphs.  In brief:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (setq shr-max-width fill-column)
  (setq shr-use-fonts nil)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is relevant for Logos as we then do not need to implement special
casing for <code>logos-focus-mode</code> to work nicely with <code>eww</code> (I am
personally annoyed when a buffer has its own opinions about font
settings).
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Ypot for discussing this in issue 4 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/logos/issues/4">https://github.com/protesilaos/logos/issues/4</a>.
</p>

<p>
[ For font-related customisations check the <code>fontaine</code> package on GNU
  ELPA (by me). ]
</p></li>

<li>Named the mailing list address as the <code>Maintainer:</code> of Logos.
Together with the other package headers, they help the user find our
primary sources and/or communication channels.  This change conforms
with work being done upstream in package.el by Philip Kaludercic.  I
was informed about it here:

<li>The new user option <code>logos-hide-fringe</code> conceals the fringe by
applying the same background as the default face.  It does not
interfere with <code>fringe-mode</code>, such as by adjusting its size.  This
option complements <code>logos-olivetti</code> and is only relevant if the
<code>fringe</code> face has a distinct background.</li>

<li>The new <code>logos-focus-mode-extra-functions</code> is an ordinary hook that
unlocks the potential of <code>logos-focus-mode</code> by allowing the user to
trigger any effect when the mode is toggled.  Its doc string
references functions from <code>logos.el</code> that can be adapted at the user
level to pursue varied ends, while the manual furnishes a ready-to-use
sample for <code>org-indent-mode</code>.  This feature was inspired by the
inquiry of Ypot in issue 1 over at the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/logos/issues/1">https://github.com/protesilaos/logos/issues/1</a>.</li>

<li>The default value of the user option <code>logos-outline-regexp-alist</code> now
includes an entry for <code>markdown-mode</code> to determine what constitutes a
heading there.  This helps with motions such as
<code>logos-forward-page-dwim</code> while it makes Markdown equally useful for a
focused reading or presentation (with <code>logos-focus-mode</code>).</li>

<li>The manual includes a link to a publication of mine where I explain
what the "devel" version of GNU ELPA is and how to make use of it:

<p>
This release basically contains one major refinement about how buffer
narrowing is handled.  In detail:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If <code>logos-outlines-are-pages</code> is non-nil, it now includes the match
of the <code>page-delimiter</code> regexp in the narrowed region and leaves
point right after the <code>page-delimiter</code>&#x2014;so in Org mode, after the
stars.  (It is better to leave point there than at the very beginning
of the narrowed buffer to match the behavior of
<code>logos-forward-page-dwim</code> when the buffer is not narrowed.)  The
inclusion of the delimiter helps retain any folding functionality
associated with that line (e.g. Org headings).</li>

<li>To avoid skipping pages in the narrowed case when point is at their
outer boundaries, <code>logos</code> checks if you are right at the start of a
<code>page-delimiter</code> and if so moves past the delimiter in the opposite
direction of the given motion: so if you are moving back, it puts you
after the delimiter, and if you are moving forward it puts you before
the delimiter.  (The bug was that if the point was at <code>point-max</code>
while narrowed and moving forward, it would skip past a page and the
same in the opposite direction with <code>point-min</code>.)</li>

<li>Changed <code>logos-narrow-dwim</code> to call <code>logos--narrow-to-page</code> instead
of <code>narrow-to-page</code>, so that it too includes the <code>page-delimiter</code>
match in the page.</li>

<li>The <code>logos--page-p</code> now always checks for the right delimiter, which
may be that of the outline if <code>logos-outlines-are-pages</code> is non-nil.
Whereas before it was hard-coded to the generic <code>page-delimiter</code>.</li>
</ol>

All functions or variables referenced herein have documentation strings
and are also documented in the manual.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Implemented the user option <code>logos-olivetti</code> which is a buffer-local
variable that is read when <code>logos-focus-mode</code> is enabled.  This
provides the glue code to integrate Logos with <code>olivetti</code>.  Olivetti
is a package by Paul W. Rankin which centres the contents of the
buffer in its window.</li>

<li>Removed the do-it-yourself snippet that was present in the manual for
piecing together Logos and Olivetti.  The documentation has been
updated accordingly.  Users who followed the old method are advised to
review their configurations.</li>

<li>Abstracted the state handling of the variables and modes that are
affected by <code>logos-focus-mode</code>, based on feedback by Daniel Mendler.
This improves how the code is written and makes it easier to extend
it.</li>

<li>Introduced the user options <code>logos-indicate-buffer-boundaries</code> and
<code>logos-buffer-read-only</code>.  Both are buffer-local and both take effect
when <code>logos-focus-mode</code> is enabled.  The former controls the
<code>indicate-buffer-boundaries</code> while the latter determines whether the
buffer should be put in a read-only mode.</li>

<li>Changed how user options are declared as buffer-local, by using the
appropriate keyword of <code>defcustom</code>.  Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for
the patch, which was sent via email.</li>

<li>Wrote a node entry on how to write a regular expression that targets
only specific Org heading levels.  This pertains to user options
<code>logos-outlines-are-pages</code> and <code>logos-outline-regexp-alist</code>.</li>

<li>Added keywords to the package metadata to help its discoverability.</li>

<li>Fixed typo in a function's doc string.  Thanks to Remco van 't Veer
for the contribution in merge request 1:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/logos/-/merge_requests/1">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/logos/-/merge_requests/1</a>.</li>

In the beginning, there was <code>prot-logos.el</code>.  A file that pieced
together some code and configurations I had for presentations (part of
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>).  On 2022-03-02 I decided to take the code out of my
personal setup and turn it into a general purpose package.
</p>

<p>
It occured to me that "logos" is a nice word though it might be a bit
dull for an Emacs package, so I coined the backcronyms "<sup>L</sup> Only
Generates Ostensible Slides" and "Logos Optionally Garners Outline
Sections", which hopefully describe what this is all about.
</p>

<p>
Read the manual for the technicalities.
