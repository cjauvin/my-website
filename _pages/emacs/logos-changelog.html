This release basically contains one major refinement about how buffer
narrowing is handled.  In detail:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If <code>logos-outlines-are-pages</code> is non-nil, it now includes the match
of the <code>page-delimiter</code> regexp in the narrowed region and leaves
point right after the <code>page-delimiter</code>&#x2014;so in Org mode, after the
stars.  (It is better to leave point there than at the very beginning
of the narrowed buffer to match the behavior of
<code>logos-forward-page-dwim</code> when the buffer is not narrowed.)  The
inclusion of the delimiter helps retain any folding functionality
associated with that line (e.g. Org headings).</li>

<li>To avoid skipping pages in the narrowed case when point is at their
outer boundaries, <code>logos</code> checks if you are right at the start of a
<code>page-delimiter</code> and if so moves past the delimiter in the opposite
direction of the given motion: so if you are moving back, it puts you
after the delimiter, and if you are moving forward it puts you before
the delimiter.  (The bug was that if the point was at <code>point-max</code>
while narrowed and moving forward, it would skip past a page and the
same in the opposite direction with <code>point-min</code>.)</li>

<li>Changed <code>logos-narrow-dwim</code> to call <code>logos--narrow-to-page</code> instead
of <code>narrow-to-page</code>, so that it too includes the <code>page-delimiter</code>
match in the page.</li>

<li>The <code>logos--page-p</code> now always checks for the right delimiter, which
may be that of the outline if <code>logos-outlines-are-pages</code> is non-nil.
Whereas before it was hard-coded to the generic <code>page-delimiter</code>.</li>
</ol>

All functions or variables referenced herein have documentation strings
and are also documented in the manual.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Implemented the user option <code>logos-olivetti</code> which is a buffer-local
variable that is read when <code>logos-focus-mode</code> is enabled.  This
provides the glue code to integrate Logos with <code>olivetti</code>.  Olivetti
is a package by Paul W. Rankin which centres the contents of the
buffer in its window.</li>

<li>Removed the do-it-yourself snippet that was present in the manual for
piecing together Logos and Olivetti.  The documentation has been
updated accordingly.  Users who followed the old method are advised to
review their configurations.</li>

<li>Abstracted the state handling of the variables and modes that are
affected by <code>logos-focus-mode</code>, based on feedback by Daniel Mendler.
This improves how the code is written and makes it easier to extend
it.</li>

<li>Introduced the user options <code>logos-indicate-buffer-boundaries</code> and
<code>logos-buffer-read-only</code>.  Both are buffer-local and both take effect
when <code>logos-focus-mode</code> is enabled.  The former controls the
<code>indicate-buffer-boundaries</code> while the latter determines whether the
buffer should be put in a read-only mode.</li>

<li>Changed how user options are declared as buffer-local, by using the
appropriate keyword of <code>defcustom</code>.  Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for
the patch, which was sent via email.</li>

<li>Wrote a node entry on how to write a regular expression that targets
only specific Org heading levels.  This pertains to user options
<code>logos-outlines-are-pages</code> and <code>logos-outline-regexp-alist</code>.</li>

<li>Added keywords to the package metadata to help its discoverability.</li>

<li>Fixed typo in a function's doc string.  Thanks to Remco van 't Veer

In the beginning, there was <code>prot-logos.el</code>.  A file that pieced
together some code and configurations I had for presentations (part of
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>).  On 2022-03-02 I decided to take the code out of my
personal setup and turn it into a general purpose package.
</p>

<p>
It occured to me that "logos" is a nice word though it might be a bit
dull for an Emacs package, so I coined the backcronyms "<sup>L</sup> Only
Generates Ostensible Slides" and "Logos Optionally Garners Outline
Sections", which hopefully describe what this is all about.

Read the manual for the technicalities.
