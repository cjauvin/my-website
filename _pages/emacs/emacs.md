## Modus themes

Highly accessible themes, conforming with the highest standard for
colour contrast between background and foreground values (WCAG AAA).
They also are optimised for users with red-green colour deficiency.

The themes are very customisable and provide support for a very wide
range of packages.  Their manual is detailed so that new users can get
started, while it also provides custom code for all sorts of more
advanced customisations.

Since August 2020, the Modus themes (`modus-operandi`, `modus-vivendi`)
are built into Emacs version 28 or higher.

## Denote

Denote is a simple note-taking tool.  It is based on the idea that notes
should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming scheme.  The
file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is about,
without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically streamlines
the creation of such files while providing facilities to link between
them.

[Watch the video demo that was produced before version 0.1.0 of the
package](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-06-18-denote-demo/).

## Ef (εὖ) themes

The `ef-themes` are a collection of light and dark themes for GNU
Emacs that provide colourful ("pretty") yet legible options for users
who want something with a bit more flair than the `modus-themes` (also
designed by me).

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `ef-themes`

+ Backronym: Extremely Fatigued of Themes Having Exaggerated Markings,
  Embellishments, and Sparkles.

## Standard themes

The `standard-themes` are a pair of light and dark themes for GNU
Emacs.  They emulate the out-of-the-box looks of Emacs (which
technically do NOT constitute a theme) while bringing to them thematic
consistency, customizability, and extensibility.  In practice, the
Standard themes take the default style of the font-lock and Org faces,
complement it with a wider colour palette, address some
inconsistencies, and apply established semantic patterns across all
interfaces.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `standard-themes`

+ Backronym: Standard Themes Are Not Derivatives but the
  Affectionately Reimagined Default ... themes.

## Fontaine

Fontaine allows the user to define detailed font configurations and set
them on demand.  For example, one can have a `regular-editing` preset
and another for `presentation-mode` (these are arbitrary, user-defined
symbols): the former uses small fonts which are optimised for writing,
while the latter applies typefaces that are pleasant to read at
comfortable point sizes.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `fontaine`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/fontaine>

+ Backronym: Fonts, Ornaments, and Neat Typography Are Irrelevant in Non-graphical Emacs

## TMR

TMR is an Emacs package that provides facilities for setting timers
using a convenient notation.  Lots of commands are available to operate
on timers, while there also exists a tabulated view to display all
timers in a nice grid.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `tmr`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/tmr>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/tmr-changelog>

+ Mailing list: <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/tmr>
+ Backronym: TMR May Ring; Time Must Run

## aLtCaPs

Transform words to alternating letter casing in order to convey
sarcasm or mockery.  For example, convert `I respect the authorities`
to `i ReSpEcT tHe AuThOrItIeS`.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `altcaps`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/altcaps>

+ Backronyms: Alternating Letters Transform Casual Asides to Playful
  Statements.  ALTCAPS Lets Trolls Convert Aphorisms to Proper
  Shitposts.

## Logos

This package provides a simple approach to setting up a "focus mode".
It uses the `page-delimiter` (typically `^L`) or the outline together
with some commands to move between pages whether narrowing is in effect
or not.  It also provides some optional aesthetic tweaks which come into
effect when the buffer-local `logos-focus-mode` is enabled.  The manual
shows how to extend the code to achieve the desired result.

[Watch the demo of the original version of logos.el](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-03-11-emacs-logos-demo/)
(all my videos since early 2022 use `logos`).

+ Mailing list: <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/logos>
+ Backronyms: `^L` Only Generates Ostensible Slides; Logos Optionally Goes through Outline Sections

## Pulsar

This is a small package that temporarily highlights the current line
after a given function is invoked.  The affected functions are defined
in the user option `pulsar-pulse-functions`.  What Pulsar does is set up
an advice so that those functions run a hook after they are called.  The
pulse effect is added there (`pulsar-after-function-hook`).

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `pulsar`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/pulsar>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/pulsar-changelog>

+ Mailing list: <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/pulsar>
+ Backronym: Pulsar Unquestionably Luminates, Strictly Absent the Radiation

## Lin

Lin is a stylistic enhancement for Emacs' built-in `hl-line-mode`.  It
remaps the `hl-line` face (or equivalent) buffer-locally to a style that
is optimal for major modes where line selection is the primary mode of
interaction.

The idea is that `hl-line-mode` cannot work equally well for contexts
with competing priorities: (i) line selection, or (ii) simple line
highlight.  In the former case, the current line needs to be made
prominent because it carries a specific meaning of some significance in
the given context: the user has to select a line.  Whereas in the latter
case, the primary mode of interaction does not revolve around the line
highlight itself: it may be because the focus is on editing text or
reading through the buffer's contents, so the current line highlight is
more of a reminder of the point's location on the vertical axis.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `lin`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/lin>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/lin-changelog>

    + GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/lin>
+ Mailing list: <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/lin>
+ Backronym: LIN Is Noticeable

## Cursory

Cursory provides a thin wrapper around built-in variables that affect
the style of the Emacs cursor.  The intent is to allow the user to
define preset configurations such as "block with slow blinking" or "bar
with fast blinking" and set them on demand.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `cursory`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/cursory>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/cursory-changelog>

+ Mailing list: <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/cursory>
+ Backronym: Cursors are Undeniably Reduced a Simple, Ordinary Role Yearround

## Notmuch Indicator

This is a simple package that renders an indicator with an email count
of the `notmuch` index on the Emacs mode line.  The underlying mechanism
is that of `notmuch-count(1)`, which is used to find the number of items
that match the given search terms.  In practice, the user can define one
or more searches and display their counters.  These form a string which
realistically is like: `@50 😱1000 💕0` for unread messages, bills, and
love letters, respectively.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `notmuch-indicator`
+ Git repo on SourceHut: <https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/notmuch-indicator>
  - Mirrors:
    + GitHub: <https://github.com/protesilaos/notmuch-indicator>

+ Mailing list: <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/notmuch-indicator>
+ Backronym: notmuch-... Increasingly in Need of Displaying
  Inconsequential Counters Alongside Trivia that Obscure Reality.

## Agitate (experimental)

Agitate is a collection of commands or potentially useful functions
that expand on the available version control features of Emacs.  Those
are meant to complement a workflow that relies on the built-in Version
Control framework and its accoutrements (`diff-mode.el`,
`log-view.el`, `log-edit.el`, `vc-git.el`, and potentially others).

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `agitate`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/agitate>
+ Git repo on SourceHut: <https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/agitate>

+ Backronym: Another Git Interface Trying to Agitate Tranquil Emacsers

## The official Emacs TUTORIAL in Greek

I am the author and maintainer of the `TUTORIAL.el_GR` file that is part
of Emacs 29 (current development target) since 2022-05-08.  You can find
it in the Emacs source code inside the `etc/tutorials/` directory.  If
you report a bug about it with `M-x report-emacs-bug`, consider adding
me in carbon copy (Cc).  The `etc/tutorials/TUTORIAL.translators` file
mentions the email address you should use.

## Dotemacs

My personal Emacs configuration.  It is comprehensive, both in terms of
the [custom] code it contains as well as the documentation on what each
piece of functionality does.

## Iosevka Comfy

This is not an "Emacs package" per se though I use it full time in my
Emacs setup (it complements my work on the `modus-themes` and
`fontaine`).

_Iosevka Comfy_ is a build of the Iosevka typeface with a rounded style
and open shapes, adjusted metrics, and overrides for almost all
individual glyphs in both roman (upright) and italic (slanted) variants.
It is more vertically compact than the standard upstream configuration.
Glyphs are rounder and have tailed ends or serifs only when those are
required to both impose a predictable rhythm and keep characters
distinct from each other.

The README file in the git repository covers all the technicalities.

## Minibuffer and Completions in Tandem (mct.el)

**UPDATE 2022-04-14:** Development of this package has been discontinued:
<https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-04-14-emacs-discontinue-mct/>.

Enhancements for the default minibuffer completion UI of Emacs.  In
essence, MCT is (i) a very thin layer of interactivity on top of the
out-of-the-box completion experience, and (ii) glue code that combines
built-in functionalities to make the default completion framework work
like that of more featureful third-party options.

Requires Emacs version 27 or higher.

+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/mct>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/mct-changelog>
