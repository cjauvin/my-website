<p>
Denote aims to be a simple-to-use, focused-in-scope, and effective
note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the following core design
principles:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Predictability</dt><dd>File names must follow a consistent and descriptive
naming convention (<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>).  The file name alone
should offer a clear indication of what the contents are, without
reference to any other metadatum.  This convention is not specific to
note-taking, as it is pertinent to any form of file that is part of
the user&rsquo;s long-term storage (<a href="#h:532e8e2a-9b7d-41c0-8f4b-3c5cbb7d4dca">Renaming files</a>).</dd>

<dt>Composability</dt><dd>Be a good Emacs citizen, by integrating with other
packages or built-in functionality instead of re-inventing functions
such as for filtering or greping.  Do not introduce strong
dependencies on specific libraries. The author of Denote (Protesilaos,
aka &ldquo;Prot&rdquo;) writes ordinary notes in plain text (<code>.txt</code>), switching to
an Org file only when its expanded set of functionality is required
for the task at hand (<a href="#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6">Points of entry</a>).</dd>

<dt>Portability</dt><dd>Notes are plain text and should remain portable.  The
way Denote writes file names, the front matter it included in the
note&rsquo;s header, and the links it establishes must all be adequately
usable with standard Unix tools.  No need for a databse or some
specialised software.  As Denote develops and this manual is fully
fleshed out, there will be concrete examples on how to do the
Denote-equivalent on the command-line.</dd>

<dt>Flexibility</dt><dd>Do not assume the user&rsquo;s preference for a note-taking
methodology.  Denote is conceptually similar to the Zettelkasten
Method, which you can learn more about in this detailed introduction:
<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/">https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/</a>.  Notes are atomic (one file
per note) and have a unique identifier.  However, Denote does not
enforce a particular methodology for knowledge management, such as a
restricted vocabulary or mutually exclusive sets of keywords.  It is
up to the user to apply the requisite rigor and/or creativity in
pursuit of their preferred workflow (<a href="#h:6060a7e6-f179-4d42-a9de-a9968aaebecc">Writing metanotes</a>).</dd>

<dt>Hackability</dt><dd>Denote&rsquo;s code base consists of small and reusable
functions.  They all have documentation strings.  The idea is to make
it easier for users of varying levels of expertise to understand what
is going on and make surgical interventions where necessary (e.g. to
tweak some formatting).  In this manual, we provide concrete examples
on such user-level configurations (<a href="#h:4a6d92dd-19eb-4fcc-a7b5-05ce04da3a92">Keep a journal or diary</a>).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Now the important part&#x2026;  &ldquo;Denote&rdquo; is the familiar word, though it also
is a play on the &ldquo;note&rdquo; concept.  Plus, we can come up with acronyms,
recursive or otherwise, of increasingly dubious utility like:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don&rsquo;t Ever Note Only The Epiphenomenal</li>
<li>Denote Everything Neatly; Omit The Excesses</li>
</ul>

<p>
But we&rsquo;ll let you get back to work.  Don&rsquo;t Eschew or Neglect your
Obligations, Tasks, and Engagements.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">
<p>
Notes are stored as a flat list in the <code>denote-directory</code> (i.e. no
subdirectories).  The default path is <code>~/Documents/notes</code>.
</p>

<p>
Every note produced by Denote follows this pattern (<a href="#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6">Points of entry</a>):
</p>

<pre class="example">
DATE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXTENSION
</pre>


<p>
The <code>DATE</code> field represents the date in year-month-day format followed
by the capital letter <code>T</code> (for &ldquo;time&rdquo;) and the current time in
hour-minute-second notation.  The presentation is compact:
<code>20220531T091625</code>.  The <code>DATE</code> serves as the unique identifier of each
note.
</p>

<p>
The <code>TITLE</code> field is the title of the note, as provided by the user.  It
automatically gets downcased and hyphenated.  An entry about &ldquo;Economics
in the Euro Area&rdquo; produces an <code>economics-in-the-euro-area</code> string for
the <code>TITLE</code> of the file name.
</p>

<p>
The <code>KEYWORDS</code> field consists of one or more entries demarcated by an
underscore (the separator is inserted automatically).  Each keyword is a
string provided by the user at the relevant prompt which broadly
describes the contents of the entry.  Keywords that need to be more than
one-word-long must be written with hyphens: any other character, such as
spaces or the plus sign is automatically converted into a hyphen.  So
when <code>emacs_library</code> appears in a file name, it is interpreted as two
distinct keywords, whereas <code>emacs-library</code> is one keyword.  This is
reflected in how the keywords are recorded in the note (<a href="#h:13218826-56a5-482a-9b91-5b6de4f14261">Front matter</a>).
While Denote supports multi-word keywords by default, the user option
<code>denote-allow-multi-word-keywords</code> can be set to nil to forcibly join
all words into one, meaning that an input of <code>word1 word2</code> will be
written as <code>word1word2</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>EXTENSION</code> is the file type.  By default, it is <code>.org</code> (<code>org-mode</code>)
though the user option <code>denote-file-type</code> provides support for Markdown
with YAML or TOML variants (<code>.md</code> which runs <code>markdown-mode</code>) and plain
text (<code>.txt</code> via <code>text-mode</code>).  Consult its doc string for the minutia.
While files end in the <code>.org</code> extension by default, the Denote code base
does not actually depend on org.el and/or its accoutrements.
</p>

<p>
Examples:
</p>

<pre class="example">

20220610T162327--on-hierarchy-and-taxis__notetaking_philosophy.txt
</pre>


<p>
The different field separators, namely <code>--</code> and <code>__</code> introduce an
efficient way to anchor searches (such as with Emacs commands like
<code>isearch</code> or from the command-line with <code>find</code> and related).  A query
for <code>_word</code> always matches a keyword, while a regexp in the form of,
say, <code>"\\([0-9T]+?\\)--\\(.*?\\)_"</code> captures the date in group <code>\1</code> and
the title in <code>\2</code> (test any regular expression in the current buffer by
invoking <code>M-x re-builder</code>).
</p>

<a href="#h:8ed2bb6f-b5be-4711-82e9-8bee5bb06ece">Extending Denote</a>.
</p>

<p>
While Denote is an Emacs package, notes should work long-term and not
depend on the functionality of a specific program.  The file-naming
scheme we apply guarantees that a listing is readable in a variety of
contexts.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-h:ae8b19a1-7f67-4258-96b3-370a72c43f4e" class="outline-3">

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:ae8b19a1-7f67-4258-96b3-370a72c43f4e">
<p>
Denote has to be highly opinionated about which characters can be used
in file names and the file&rsquo;s front matter in order to enforce its
file-naming scheme.  The private variable <code>denote--punctuation-regexp</code>
holds the relevant value.  In simple terms:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What we count as &ldquo;illegal characters&rdquo; are converted into hyphens.</li>

<li>Input for a file title is hyphenated and downcased.  The original
value is preserved only in the note&rsquo;s contents (<a href="#h:13218826-56a5-482a-9b91-5b6de4f14261">Front matter</a>).</li>

<li>Keywords should not have spaces or other delimiters.  If they do, they
are converted into hyphens.  Keywords are always downcased.</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6">
<p>
There are four ways to write a note with Denote: invoke the <code>denote</code>,
<code>denote-type</code>, <code>denote-date</code> commands, or leverage the
<code>org-capture-templates</code> by setting up a template which calls the
function <code>denote-org-capture</code>.
</p>

<p>
In the first case, all that is needed is to run <code>denote</code>.  It will
prompt for a title.  Once it is supplied, the command will ask for
keywords.  The resulting note will have a file name as already explained
(<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file naming scheme</a>).

The keyword prompt supports minibuffer completion.  Available candidates
are those defined in the user option <code>denote-known-keywords</code>.  More
candidates can be inferred from the names of existing notes, by setting
<code>denote-infer-keywords</code> to non-nil (which is the case by default).
</p>

<p>
Multiple keywords can be inserted by separating them with a comma (or
whatever the value of the <code>crm-indicator</code> is&#x2014;which should be a comma).
When the user option <code>denote-sort-keywords</code> is non-nil (the default),
keywords are sorted alphabetically (technically, the sorting is done
with <code>string-lessp</code>).
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote</code> command can also be called from Lisp, in which case it
expects the <code>TITLE</code> and <code>KEYWORDS</code> arguments.  The former is a string,
the latter a list of strings.
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-type</code> command is like <code>denote</code> except it also prompts for a
file type to use as a local value for <code>denote-file-type</code>.  In practical
terms, this lets you produce, say, a note in Markdown even though you
normally write in Org (<a href="#h:f34b172b-3440-446c-aec1-bf818d0aabfe">Notes in multiple file types</a>).
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the <code>denote-date</code> command accepts the same <code>TITLE</code> and
<code>KEYWORDS</code> arguments, though it starts by asking for a date.  Normally,
Denote use the current date and time to construct an identifier, but
<code>denote-date</code> allows the user to specify any date+time combination.  The
input for the <code>DATE</code> argument is like <code>2022-06-16</code> or <code>2022-06-16
14:30</code>.  When the time is omitted, it is interpreted as <code>00:00</code>.
</p>

<p>
Since the ability to insert a date may result in duplicate identifiers,
Denote takes care to abort the operation if such an identity is
established (e.g. when you use <code>denote-date</code> with <code>2022-06-16</code> twice, it
will generate the same identifier of <code>20220616T000000</code>).  The user must
thus call the <code>denote-date</code> command again and provide a unique value.
</p>

<p>
For integration with <code>org-capture</code>, the user must first add the relevant
template.  Such as:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(with-eval-after-load 'org-capture
  (require 'denote-org-capture)
  (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
               '("n" "New note (with Denote)" plain
                 (file denote-last-path)
                 #'denote-org-capture
                 :no-save t
                 :immediate-finish nil
                 :kill-buffer t
                 :jump-to-captured t)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
[ In the future, we might develop Denote in ways which do not require such
  manual intervation. ]
</p>

<p>
Once the template is added, it is accessed from the specified key.  If,
for instance, <code>org-capture</code> is bound to <code>C-c c</code>, then the note creation
is initiated with <code>C-c c n</code>.  After that, the process is the same as
with invoking <code>denote</code> directly, namely: a prompt for a title followed
by a prompt for keywords.
</p>

<p>
Users may prefer to leverage <code>org-capture</code> in order to extend file
creation with the specifiers described in the <code>org-capture-templates</code>
documentation (such as to capture the active region and/or create a
hyperlink pointing to the given context).  Due to the particular
file-naming scheme of Denote, such specifiers cannot be written directly
in the template.  Instead, they have to be assigned to the user option
<code>denote-org-capture-specifiers</code>, which is interpreted by the function
<code>denote-org-capture</code>.  Example with our default value:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq denote-org-capture-specifiers "%l\n%i\n%?")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that <code>denote-org-capture</code> ignores the <code>denote-file-type</code>: it always
sets the Org file extension for the created note to ensure that the
capture process works as intended, especially for the desired output of
the <code>denote-org-capture-specifiers</code>.
</p>

<p>
For convencience, the <code>denote</code> command has a <code>denote-create-note</code> alias.
Same for <code>denote-type</code> which is <code>denote-create-note-using-type</code> and
<code>denote-date</code> that has <code>denote-create-note-using-date</code>.  The purpose of
these aliases is to provide alternative, more descriptive names of
select commands to aid with discoverability.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-h:532e8e2a-9b7d-41c0-8f4b-3c5cbb7d4dca">
<p>
Denote&rsquo;s file-naming scheme is not specific to notes or text files: it
is useful for all sorts of files, such as multimedia and PDFs that form
part of the user&rsquo;s longer-term storage (<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>).  While
Denote does not manage such files, it already has all the mechanisms to
facilitate the task of renaming them.
</p>

<p>
To this end, we provide the <code>denote-dired-rename-file</code> command.  It has
a two-fold purpose: (i) to change the name of an existing file while
retaining its identifier and (ii) to write a Denote-compliant file name
for an item that was not created by <code>denote</code> or related commands (such
as an image or PDF).
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-dired-rename-file</code> command will target the file at point if
it finds one in the current Dired buffer.  Otherwise it prompts with
minibuffer completion for a file name.  It then uses the familiar
prompts for a <code>TITLE</code> and <code>KEYWORDS</code> the same way the <code>denote</code> command
does (<a href="#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6">Points of entry</a>).  As a final step, it asks for confirmation
before renaming the file at point, showing a message like:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgbf6dbe6">
Rename sample.pdf to 20220612T052900--my-sample-title__testing.pdf? (y or n)
</pre>

<p>
However, if the user option <code>denote-dired-rename-expert</code> is non-nil,
conduct the renaming operation outright&#x2014;no questions asked.
</p>

<p>
When operating on a file that has no identifier, such as <code>sample.pdf</code>,
Denote reads the file properties to retrieve its last modification time.
If the file was from a past date like 2000-11-31 it will get an
identifier starting with <code>20001131</code> followed by the time component (per
our file-naming scheme).
</p>

<p>
The file type extension (e.g. <code>.pdf</code>) is read from the underlying file
and is preserved through the renaming process.  Files that have no
extension are simply left without one.
</p>

<p>
Renaming only occurs relative to the current directory.  Files are not
moved between directories.
</p>

<p>
The final step of the <code>denote-dired-rename-file</code> command is to call the
special hook <code>denote-dired-post-rename-functions</code>.  Functions added to
that hook must accept three arguments, as explained in its doc string.
For the time being, the only function we define is the one which updates
the underlying note&rsquo;s front matter to match the new file name:
<code>denote-dired-rewrite-front-matter</code>.  The function takes care to only
operate on an actual note, instead of arbitrary files.
</p>

<p>
DEVELOPMENT NOTE: the <code>denote-dired-rewrite-front-matter</code> needs to be
tested thoroughly.  It rewrites file contents so we have to be sure it
does the right thing.  To avoid any trouble, it always asks for
confirmation before performing the replacement.  This confirmation
ignores <code>denote-dired-rename-expert</code> for the time being, though we might
want to lift that restriction once everything works as intended.
</p>

<p>
Notes have their own &ldquo;front matter&rdquo;.  This is a block of data at the top
of the file, which is automatically generated at the creation of a new
note. The front matter includes the title and keywords (aka &ldquo;tags&rdquo; or
&ldquo;filetags&rdquo;, depending on the file type) which the user specified at the
relevant prompt, as well as the date and unique identifier which are
derived automatically.
</p>

<p>
This is how it looks for Org mode (<code>denote-file-type</code> is nil):
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org6fb067c">
#+title:      This is a sample note
#+date:       2022-06-10
#+filetags:   denote  testing
#+identifier: 20220610T202537
</pre>

<p>
For Markdown with YAML, it looks like this (<code>denote-file-type</code> has the
<code>markdown-yaml</code> value):
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org448c508">
---
title:      "This is a sample note"
date:       2022-06-10
tags:       denote  testing
identifier: "20220610T202021"
---
</pre>

<p>
For Markdown with TOML, it looks like this (<code>denote-file-type</code> has the
<code>markdown-toml</code> value):
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgf609d1c">
+++
title      = "This is a sample note"
date       = 2022-06-10
tags       = ["denote", "testing"]
identifier = "20220610T201510"
+++
</pre>

<p>
And for plain text, we have the following (<code>denote-file-type</code> has the
<code>text</code> value):
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org9e57916">
title:      This is a sample note
date:       2022-06-10
tags:       denote  testing
identifier: 20220610T202232
---------------------------
</pre>

<p>
The format of the date in the front matter is controlled by the user
option <code>denote-front-matter-date-format</code>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When the value is nil (the default), the date uses a plain
<code>YEAR-MONTH-DAY</code> notation, like <code>2022-06-08</code> (the ISO 8601 standard).</li>

<li>When the value is the <code>org-timestamp</code> symbol, the date is recorded as
an inactive Org timestamp, such as <code>[2022-06-08 Wed 06:19]</code>.</li>

<li>An arbitrary string value is interpreted as the argument for the
function <code>format-time-string</code>.  This gives the user maximum control
over how time is represented in the front matter.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When <code>denote-file-type</code> specifies one of the Markdown flavors, we ignore
this user option in order to enforce the RFC3339 specification (Markdown
is typically employed in static site generators as source code for Web
pages).  However, when <code>denote-front-matter-date-format</code> has a string
value, this rule is suspended: we use whatever the user wants.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-h:f69371d5-1843-493d-9ff5-c1ab3b43024e" class="outline-3">

<p>
What follows is for advanced users.  When in doubt, only configure
variables we describe as a &ldquo;user option&rdquo;: they are declared in the
source code with the <code>defcustom</code> keyword.
</p>

<p>
Denote&rsquo;s code base is designed in a composable way, which lets the user
make precise interventions to affect the output of the relevant
commands.  One such case is to configure the front matter, such as by
changing the order the keys appear in, renaming them, or adding new
elements.
</p>

<p>
Some examples are in order, starting with the Org file type.  This is
what we have in <code>denote.el</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defvar denote-org-front-matter
  "#+title:      %s
#+date:       %s
#+filetags:   %s
#+identifier: %s
\n"
  "Org front matter value for `format'.
The order of the arguments is TITLE, DATE, KEYWORDS, ID.  If you
are an avdanced user who wants to edit this variable to affect
how front matter is produced, consider using something like %2$s
to control where Nth argument is placed.")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The default front matter is:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgf977d0f">
#+title:      This is a sample note
#+date:       2022-06-10
#+filetags:   denote  testing
#+identifier: 20220610T202537
</pre>

<p>
We can add a <code>PROPERTIES</code> drawer to it, with something like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq denote-org-front-matter
      ":PROPERTIES:
:ID: %4$s
:END:
#+title:      %1$s
#+date:       %2$s
#+filetags:   %3$s
#+identifier: %4$s
\n")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The output is now formatted thus:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgf033a77">
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 20220611T092444
:END:
#+title:      This is a sample note
#+date:       2022-06-11
#+filetags:   denote  testing
#+identifier: 20220611T092444
</pre>

<p>
Notice how we can pass a number to the <code>%s</code> specifier.  This is what
allows us to change the placement of the provided arguments.
</p>

<p>
For another example, we will use the plain text variant, as it differs a
bit from the above.  By default it is formatted this way:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org489553a">
title:      This is a sample note
date:       2022-06-10
tags:       denote  testing
identifier: 20220610T202232
---------------------------
</pre>

<p>
The line with the hyphens is the product of the fifth format specifier,
as documented in <code>denote-text-front-matter</code>.  Its value is stored in
<code>denote-text-front-matter-delimiter</code>.  Say we want to have a delimiter
both at the top and bottom:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq denote-text-front-matter
      "%5$s
title:      %1$s
date:       %2$s
tags:       %3$s
identifier: %4$s
%5$s\n\n")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Which gives us:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgbd48a9d">
---------------------------
title:      This is a sample note
date:       2022-06-11
tags:       denote  testing
identifier: 20220611T093252
---------------------------
</pre>

<p>
Or we would rather use another character instead of hyphens, such as the
equals sign:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq denote-text-front-matter-delimiter (make-string 27 ?=))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Remember that this is for advanced users.  If you want to see changes
done on this front, you are welcome to share your thoughts and/or
participate in the development of Denote.

<p>
DEVELOPMENT NOTE 2022-06-19 22:48 +0300: This is the final part that
remains to be finalised before the release of the first stable version
(planned for 2022-06-22&#x2013;2022-06-24).  There still are some updates to
be made.
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-link</code> command inserts a link at point to an entry specified
at the minibuffer prompt.  Links are formatted depending on the file
type of current note.  In Org and plain text buffers, links are
formatted thus: <code>[[denote:IDENTIFIER][TITLE]]</code>.  While in Markdown they
are expressed as <code>[TITLE](denote:IDENTIFIER)</code>.
</p>

<p>
When <code>denote-link</code> is called with a prefix argument (<code>C-u</code> by default)
it formats links like <code>[[denote:IDENTIFIER]]</code>.  The user might prefer
its simplicity.
</p>

<p>
Inserted links are automatically buttonized and remain active for as
long as the buffer is available.  In Org this is handled automatically
as Denote creates its own custom hyperlink: the <code>denote:</code> type which
works exactly like the <code>file:</code>.  In Markdown and plain text, Denote
handles the buttonization of those links.
</p>

<p>
To buttonize links in existing files while visiting them, the user must
add this snippet to their setup:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-hook 'find-file-hook #'denote-link-buttonize-buffer)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Denote has a major-mode-agnostic mechanism to collect all linked file
references in the current buffer and return them as an appropriately
formatted list.  This list can then be used in interactive commands.
The <code>denote-link-find-file</code> is such a command.  It uses minibuffer
completion to visit a file that is linked to from the current note.  The
candidates have the correct metadata, which is ideal for integration
with other standards-compliant tools (<a href="#h:8ed2bb6f-b5be-4711-82e9-8bee5bb06ece">Extending Denote</a>).  For instance,
a package such as <code>marginalia</code> will display accurate annotations, while
the <code>embark</code> package will be able to work its magic such as in exporting
the list into a filtered Dired buffer (i.e. a familiar Dired listing
with only the files of the current minibuffer session).
</p>

<p>
The command <code>denote-link-backlinks</code> produces a bespoke buffer which
displays the file name of all notes linking to the current one.  Each
file name appears on its own line and is buttonized so that it performs
the action of visiting the referenced file.  [Development note:
currently this depends on the <code>find</code> executable.  Maybe we can make it
work with Emacs&rsquo; <code>xref</code> facility to work everywhere without losing the
bespoke buffer?]  The backlinks&rsquo; buffer looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org86c9465">
Backlinks to "On being honest" (20220614T130812)
------------------------------------------------

20220614T145606--let-this-glance-become-a-stare__journal.txt
20220616T182958--not-feeling-butterflies-in-your-stomach__journal.txt
</pre>

<p>
The backlinks&rsquo; buffer is fontified by default, though the user has
access to the <code>denote-link-fontify-backlinks</code> option to disable this
effect by setting its value to nil.
</p>

<p>
The placement of the backlinks&rsquo; buffer is subject to the user option
<code>denote-link-backlinks-display-buffer-action</code>.  Due to the nature of the
underlying <code>display-buffer</code> mechanism, this inevitably is an advanced
feature.  By default, the backlinks&rsquo; buffer is displayed below the
current window.  The doc string of our user option includes a
configuration that places the buffer in a left side window instead.
Reproducing it here for your convenience:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq denote-link-backlinks-display-buffer-action
      '((display-buffer-reuse-window
         display-buffer-in-side-window)
        (side . left)
        (slot . 99)
        (window-width . 0.3)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The command <code>denote-link-add-links</code> adds links at point matching a
regular expression or plain string.  The links are inserted as a
typographic list, such as:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd99e6ec">
- link1
- link2
- link3
</pre>

<p>
Each link is formatted according to the file type of the current note,
as explained further above about the <code>denote-link</code> command.  The current
note is excluded from the matching entries (adding a link to itself is
pointless).
</p>

<p>
When called with a prefix argument (<code>C-u</code>) <code>denote-link-add-links</code> will
format all links as <code>[[denote:IDENTIFIER]]</code>, hence a typographic list:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org0e4d98c">
- [[denote:IDENTIFIER-1]]
- [[denote:IDENTIFIER-2]]
- [[denote:IDENTIFIER-3]]
</pre>

<p>
Same examples of a regular expression that can be used with this
command:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>journal</code> match all files which include <code>journal</code> anywhere in their
name.</li>

<li><code>_journal</code> match all files which include <code>journal</code> as a keyword.</li>

<li><code>^2022.*_journal</code> match all file names starting with <code>2022</code> and
including the keyword <code>journal</code>.</li>

<li><code>\.txt</code> match all files including <code>.txt</code>.  In practical terms, this
only applies to the file extension, as Denote automatically removes
dots (and other characters) from the base file name.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If files are created with <code>denote-sort-keywords</code> as non-nil (the
default), then it is easy to write a regexp that includes multiple
keywords in alphabetic order:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>_denote.*_package</code> match all files that include both the <code>denote</code> and
<code>package</code> keywords, in this order.</li>

<li><code>\(.*denote.*package.*\)\|\(.*package.*denote.*\)</code> is the same as
above, but out-of-order.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Remember that regexp constructs only need to be escaped once (like <code>\|</code>)
when done interactively but twice when called from Lisp.  What we show
above is for interactive usage.
</p>

<p>
For convenience, the <code>denote-link</code> command has an alias called
<code>denote-link-insert-link</code>.  The <code>denote-link-backlinks</code> can also be used
as <code>denote-link-show-backlinks-buffer</code>.  While <code>denote-link-add-links</code>
is aliased <code>denote-link-insert-links-matching-regexp</code>.  The purpose of
these aliases is to offer alternative, more descriptive names of select
commands.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:6060a7e6-f179-4d42-a9de-a9968aaebecc">
<p>
A &ldquo;metanote&rdquo; is an entry that describes other entries who have something
in common.  Writing metanotes can be part of a workflow where the user
periodically reviews their work in search of patterns and deeper
insights.  For example, you might want to read your journal entries from
the past year to reflect on your experiences, evolution as a person, and
the like.
</p>

<p>
The command <code>denote-link-add-links</code>, which we covered extensively in the
previous section, is suited for this task (<a href="#h:fc913d54-26c8-4c41-be86-999839e8ad31">Linking notes</a>).  You will
create your metanote the way you use Denote ordinarily (metanotes may
have the <code>metanote</code> keyword), write an introduction or however you want
to go about it, invoke <code>denote-link-add-links</code> to cite the notes that
match the given regexp, and continue writing.
</p>

<p>
Metanotes can serve as entry points to groupings of individual notes.
They are not the same as a filtered list of files, i.e. what you would
do in Dired or the minibuffer where you narrow the list of notes to a
given query.  Metanotes contain the filtered list plus your thoughts
about it.  The act of purposefully grouping notes together and
contemplating on their shared patterns is what adds value.
</p>

<p>
Your future self will appreciate metanotes for the function they serve

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-h:337f9cf0-9f66-45af-b73f-f6370472fb51">
<p>
One of the upsides of Denote&rsquo;s file-naming scheme is the predictable
pattern it establishes, which appears as a near-tabular presentation in
a listing of notes (i.e. in Dired).  The <code>denote-dired-mode</code> can help
enhance this impression, by fontifying the components of the file name
to make the date (identifier) and keywords stand out.
</p>

<p>
There are two ways to set the mode.  Either use it for all directories,
which probably is not needed:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(require 'denote-dired)
(add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'denote-dired-mode)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Or configure the user option <code>denote-dired-directories</code> and then set up
the function <code>denote-dired-mode-in-directories</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(require 'denote-dired)

;; We use different ways to specify a path for demo purposes.
(setq denote-dired-directories
      (list denote-directory
            (thread-last denote-directory (expand-file-name "attachments"))
            (expand-file-name "~/Documents/vlog")))

(add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'denote-dired-mode-in-directories)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The faces we define are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>denote-dired-field-date</code></li>
<li><code>denote-dired-field-delimiter</code></li>
<li><code>denote-dired-field-extension</code></li>
<li><code>denote-dired-field-keywords</code></li>
<li><code>denote-dired-field-time</code></li>
<li><code>denote-dired-field-title</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
For the time being, the <code>diredfl</code> package is not compatible with this
facility.
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-dired-mode</code> does not only fontify note files that were
created by Denote: it covers every file name that follows our naming
conventions (<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>).  This is particularly useful for
scenaria where, say, one wants to organise their collection of PDFs and
multimedia in a systematic way (and, perhaps, use them as attachments
for the notes Denote produces).
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-h:82dc1203-d689-44b2-9a6c-b37776209651">
<p>
Denote has a dedicated minibuffer history for each one of its prompts.
This practically means that using <code>M-p</code> (<code>previous-history-element</code>) and
<code>M-n</code> (<code>next-history-element</code>) will only cycle through the relevant
record of inputs, such as your latest titles in the <code>TITLE</code> prompt, and
keywords in the <code>KEYWORDS</code> prompt.
</p>

<p>
The built-in <code>savehist</code> library saves minibuffer histories.  Sample
configuration:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(require 'savehist)
(setq savehist-file (locate-user-emacs-file "savehist"))

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-h:f34b172b-3440-446c-aec1-bf818d0aabfe">
<p>
As noted before, Denote does not have a particular preference on the
workflow the user wishes to follow nor does it expect a specific file
type.  It is entirely possible to store notes in a variety of formats
across multiple directories and Denote will still be able to work with
them, provided they follow the file-naming scheme and have an identifier
in their front matter, where relevant.  Here we show how to create new
notes that take the example of the <code>denote-type</code> command and take it one
step further.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you want to use the <code>denote</code> command to store some notes in
Markdown, others in Org, and others still in plain text.  Maybe you also
want to place each of those in its own directory.  Using the
<code>denote-type</code> command is not sufficient, as it only operates on the
value of the user option <code>denote-directory</code>.  You need some small
wrapper functions.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>~/Documents/notes/</code> is your default and contains Org files.</li>
<li><code>~/Documents/blog/</code> holds the files of your blog.</li>
<li><code>~/Documents/random/</code> is where you scribble thoughts in plain text.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Why would you do that?  It does not matter.  This is for didactic
purposes.  All you need to do is write functions that <code>let</code> bind the
<code>denote-directory</code> and to the desired value.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun my-denote-markdown-toml ()
  "Create Markdown+TOML note in ~/Documents/blog/."
  (interactive)
  (let ((denote-file-type 'markdown-toml)
        (denote-directory "~/Documents/blog/"))
    (call-interactively #'denote)))

(defun my-denote-plain-text ()
  "Create plain text note in ~/Documents/random/."
  (interactive)
  (let ((denote-file-type 'text)
        (denote-directory "~/Documents/random/"))
    (call-interactively #'denote)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You do not need a third command for the Org files, as those would be the
default used by regular <code>denote</code>.
</p>

<p>
Given Denote&rsquo;s composable code, you can tweak the output however you
like, including the contents of the file (<a href="#h:f69371d5-1843-493d-9ff5-c1ab3b43024e">Tweaking the front matter</a>).
</p>

<p>
If you do place different types of notes in their own directories, you
must introduce directory-local variables to keep things working
seamlessly.  Otherwise you cannot create notes, retrieve backlinks, and
so on.  To that end, the <code>denote-directory</code> variable considers the
symbols <code>default-directory</code> or <code>local</code> as safe local variables.  Write a
<code>.dir-locals.el</code> file in each of your non-default notes directories with
the following contents (replacing <code>default-directory</code> with <code>local</code>, if
you prefer):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;;; Directory Local Variables
;;; For more information see (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

((nil . ((denote-directory . default-directory))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This will allow things to work smoothly (e.g. <code>denote-infer-keywords</code>).
</p>

<p>
Your default <code>denote-directory</code> does not need this, as it already is the
normal target that Denote uses.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:4a6d92dd-19eb-4fcc-a7b5-05ce04da3a92">
<p>
While there are subtle technical differences between a journal and a
diary, we will consider those equivalent in the interest of brevity:
they both describe a personal space that holds a record of your thoughts
about your experiences and/or view of events in the world.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you are committed to writing an entry every day.  Unlike what we
demonstrated before, your writing will follow a regular naming pattern
(<a href="#h:f34b172b-3440-446c-aec1-bf818d0aabfe">Notes in multiple file types</a>).  You know that the title of the new note
must always look like <code>Tuesday 14 June 2022</code> and the keyword has to be
<code>journal</code> or <code>diary</code>.  As such, you want to automate the task instead of
being prompted each time, as is the norm with <code>denote</code> and the relevant
commands (<a href="#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6">Points of entry</a>).  This is easy to accomplish because <code>denote</code>
can be called from Lisp and given the required arguments of <code>TITLE</code> and
<code>KEYWORDS</code> directly.  All you need is a simple wrapper function:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun my-denote-journal ()
  "Create an entry tagged 'journal' with the date as its title."
  (interactive)
  (denote
   (format-time-string "%A %e %B %Y") ; format like Tuesday 14 June 2022
   "journal")) ; multiple keywords are a list of strings: '("one" "two")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
By invoking <code>my-denote-journal</code> you will go straight into the newly
created note and commit to your writing outright.
</p>

<p>
Of course, you can always set up the function so that it asks for a
<code>TITLE</code> but still automatically applies the <code>journal</code> tag:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun denote-journal-with-title ()
  "Create an entry tagged 'journal', while prompting for a title."
  (interactive)
  (denote
   (denote--title-prompt) ; ask for title, instead of using human-readable date
   "journal"))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Sometimes journaling is done with the intent to hone one&rsquo;s writing
skills.  Perhaps you are learning a new language or wish to communicate
your ideas with greater clarity and precision.  As with everything that
requires a degree of sophistication, you have to work for it&#x2014;write,
write, write!
</p>

<p>
One way to test your progress is to set a timer.  It helps you gauge
your output and its quality.  To use a timer with Emacs, consider the
<code>tmr</code> package:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun my-denote-journal-with-tmr ()
  "Like `my-denote-journal', but also set a 10-minute timer.
The `tmr' command is part of the `tmr' package."
  (interactive)
  (denote
   (format-time-string "%A %e %B %Y")
   "journal")
  (tmr 10 "Practice writing in my journal")) ; set 10 minute timer with a description
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once the timer elapses, stop writing and review your performance.
Practice makes perfect!
</p>

<p>
[ As Denote matures, we may add hooks to control what happens before or
  after the creation of a new note.  We shall also document more
  examples of tasks that can be accomplished with this package. ]

Recall what we discussed elsewhere in the manual about changing the file
type and target directory (<a href="#h:f34b172b-3440-446c-aec1-bf818d0aabfe">Notes in multiple file types</a>).  You basically
<code>let</code> bind the relevant variables.  Such bindings are specific to the
function: they do not affect anything outside of it, so you can keep the
defaults for your regular notes and use something different for your
journaling.  For example, the following snippet is like the previous
sample of writing a journal entry and setting a timer, but it also uses
a plain text file type and adds the new note to the
<code>~/Documents/journal/</code> directory:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun my-denote-journal-with-tmr-and-custom-type-and-dir ()
  "Like `my-denote-journal-with-tmr' with custom type and directory."
  (interactive)
  (let ((denote-file-type 'text) ; it supports other file types as well: read its doc string
        (denote-directory "~/Documents/journal/"))
    (denote
     (format-time-string "%A %e %B %Y")
     "journal")
    (tmr 10 "Practice writing in my journal")))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Finally, we can incorporate the idea of the <code>denote-date</code> command into
our journaling workflow.  Unlike regular <code>denote</code>, this command has a
slightly different structure.  Below are variants of the aforementioned
ideas.  If you pick more than one, just give them a unique name (the
text right after <code>defun</code>):

<p>
Denote is a tool with a narrow scope: create notes and link between
them, based on the aforementioned file-naming scheme.  For other common
operations the user is advised to rely on standard Emacs facilities or
specialised third-party packages.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To search through notes, use <code>M-x grep</code>, <code>M-x find-name-dired</code>, <code>M-x
  consult-find</code>, <code>M-x consult-grep</code>, and so on (the latter two are
provided by the <code>consult</code> package).</li>

<li>To quickly jump to the <code>denote-directory</code>, visit it with <code>M-x
  find-file</code> and then make a bookmark with <code>M-x bookmark-set</code>.  Access
bookmarks with <code>M-x bookmark-jump</code>, <code>M-x consult-buffer</code> (from
<code>consult</code>), and the like.</li>

<li>Control the versioning of notes by turning the <code>denote-directory</code> into
a Git project.  Consider the built-in project.el or the <code>projectile</code>
package, as well as the built-in VC framework and/or the <code>magit</code>
package.</li>

<li>It is possible to narrow the list of notes in Dired using a regular
expression or literal string.  Do <code>M-x dired-mark-files-regexp RET
  type-regexp-here RET t k</code>.  The <code>t</code> will toggle the match so that it
marks all files that do not match the regexp and <code>k</code> will remove them
from the buffer (restore them by reverting the buffer).</li>

<li>A narrowed list of files can also be produced through the minibuffer,
with the help of the <code>embark</code> package.  For example, <code>M-x find-file
  RET path/to/denote-directory RET regexp embark-act embark-export</code>.
The final two commands, <code>embark-act</code> and <code>embark-export</code>, are normally
bound to keys.  The whole sequence will thus look like <code>C-x C-f path
  RET regexp C-. E</code>.</li>

<p>
What follows is a list of Emacs packages for note-taking.  I
(Protesilaos) have not used any of them, as I was manually applying my
file-naming scheme beforehand and by the time those packages were
available I was already hacking on the predecessor of Denote as a means
of learning Emacs Lisp (a package which I called &ldquo;Unassuming Sidenotes
of Little Significance&rdquo;, aka &ldquo;USLS&rdquo; which is pronounced as &ldquo;U-S-L-S&rdquo; or
&ldquo;useless&rdquo;).  As such, I cannot comment at length on the differences
between Denote and each of those packages, beside what I gather from
their documentation.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam">org-roam</a></dt><dd>The de facto standard in the Emacs milieu&#x2014;and rightly
so!  It has a massive community, is featureful, and should be an
excellent companion to anyone who is invested in the Org ecosystem
and/or knows what &ldquo;Roam&rdquo; is (I don&rsquo;t).  It has been explained to me
that Org Roam uses a database to store a cache about your notes.  It
otherwise uses standard Org files.  The cache helps refer to the same
node through aliases which can provide lots of options.  Personally, I
follow a single-topic-per-note approach, so anything beyond that is
overkill.  If the database is only for a cache, then maybe that has no
downside, though I am careful with any kind of specialised program as
it creates a dependency.  If you ask me about database software in
particular, I have no idea how to use one, let alone debug it or
retrieve data from it if something goes awry (I could learn, but that
is beside the point).</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/localauthor/zk">zk (or zk.el)</a></dt><dd>Reading its documentation makes me think that this is
Denote&rsquo;s sibling or cousin&#x2014;they have a lot of things in common,
including the preference to rely on plain files and standard tools.
One general difference is that Denote is trying to not replicate
existing functionality, such as by not offering its own file index as
a substitute for Dired or the minibuffer.  Another potential
difference is that Denote is not a zettelkasten implementation per se,
though I am not sure how ZK interprets or enforces that methodology.
In our case, Denote does not do zettelkasten (the user does it, if
they want to); Denote primarily creates files with a unique
identifier.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/ymherklotz/emacs-zettelkasten">zettelkasten</a></dt><dd>This is another one of Denote&rsquo;s relatives, at least
insofar as the goal of simplicity is concerned.  The major difference
is that according to its documentation &ldquo;the name of the file that is
created is just a unique ID&rdquo;.  This is not consistent with our
file-naming scheme which is all about making sense of your files by
their name alone and being able to visually parse a listing of them
without any kind of specialised tool (e.g. <code>ls -l</code> or <code>ls -C</code> on the
command-line from inside the <code>denote-directory</code> give you a
human-readable set of files names, while <code>find * -maxdepth 0 -type f</code>
is another approach).</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/EFLS/zetteldeft">zetteldeft</a></dt><dd>This is a zettelkasten note-taking system built on top
of the <code>deft</code> package.  Deft provides a search interface to a
directory, in this case the one holding the user&rsquo;s <code>zetteldeft</code> notes.
Denote has no such dependency and is not opinionated about how the
user prefers to search/access their notes: use Dired, Grep, the
<code>consult</code> package, or whatever else you already have set up for all
things Emacs, not just your notes.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Searching through <code>M-x list-packages</code> for &ldquo;zettel&rdquo; brings up more
matches.  <code>zetteldesk</code> is an extension to Org Roam and, as such, I
cannot possibly know what Org Roam truly misses and what the added-value
of this package is.  <code>neuron-mode</code> builds on top of an external program
called <code>neuron</code>, which I have never used.
</p>

<p>
Searching for &ldquo;note&rdquo; gives us a few more results.  <code>notes-mode</code> has
precious little documentation and I cannot tell what it actually does
(as I said in my presentation for LibrePlanet 2022, inadequate docs are
a bug).  <code>side-notes</code> differs from what we try to do with Denote, as it
basically gives you the means to record your thoughts about some other
project you are working on and keep them on the side: so it and Denote
should not be mutually exclusive.

If I missed something, please let me know.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:b875450a-ae22-4899-ac23-c10fa9c279bb">
<p>
I wrote Denote because I was using a variant of Denote&rsquo;s file-naming
scheme before I was even an Emacs user (I switched to Emacs from
Tmux+Vim+CLI in the summer of 2019).  I was originally inspired by
Jekyll, the static site generator, which I started using for my website
in 2016 (was on WordPress before).  Jekyll&rsquo;s files follow the
<code>YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.md</code> pattern.  I liked its efficiency relative to the
unstructured mess I had before.  Eventually, I started using that scheme
outside the confines of my website&rsquo;s source code.  Over time I refined
it and here we are.
</p>

<p>
Note-taking is something I take very seriously, as I am a prolific
writer (just check my website, which only reveals the tip of the
iceberg).  As such, I need a program that does exactly what I want and
which I know how to extend.  I originally tried to use Org capture
templates to create new files with a Denote-style file-naming scheme but
never managed to achieve it.  Maybe because <code>org-capture</code> has some
hard-coded assumptions or I simply am not competent enough to hack on
core Org facilities.  Whatever the case, an alternative was in order.
</p>

<p>
The existence of PACKAGE is never a good reason for me not to conduct my
own experiments for recreational, educational, or practical purposes.
Whether you should use Denote or not is another matter altogether:
choose whatever you want.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-h:b9831849-5c71-484e-b444-bac19cc13151" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="h:b9831849-5c71-484e-b444-bac19cc13151"><span class="section-number-3">17.2.</span> Why not rely exclusively on Org?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:b9831849-5c71-484e-b444-bac19cc13151">
<p>
I think Org is one of Emacs&rsquo; killer apps.  I also believe it is not the
right tool for every job.  When I write notes, I want to focus on
writing.  Nothing more.  I thus have no need for stuff like org-babel,
scheduling to-do items, clocking time, and so on.  The more &ldquo;mental
dependencies&rdquo; you add to your workflow, the heavier the burden you carry
and the less focused you are on the task at hand.
</p>

<p>
In technical terms, I also am not fond of Org&rsquo;s code base (I understand
why it is the way it is&#x2014;just commenting on the fact).  Ever tried to
read it?  You will routinely find functions that are tens-to-hundreds of
lines long and have all sorts of special casing.  As I am not a
programmer and only learnt to write Elisp through trial and error, I
have no confidence in my ability to make Org do what I want at that
level.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the master programmer is one who can deal with complexity and
keep adding to it.  I am of the opposite view as language&#x2014;code
included&#x2014;is at its communicative best when it is clear and accessible.
</p>

<p>
Make no mistake: I use Org for the agenda and also to write technical
documentation that needs to be exported to various formats, including
this very manual.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:da1e2469-8f04-450b-a379-a854efa80a36">
<p>
My notes form part of my longer-term storage.  I do not want to have to
rely on a special program to be able to read them or filter them.  Unix
is universal, at least as far as I am concerned.
</p>

<p>
Denote streamlines some tasks and makes things easier in general, which
is consistent with how Emacs provides a layer of interactivity on top of
Unix.  Still, Denote&rsquo;s utilities can, in principle, be implemented as
POSIX shell scripts (minus the Emacs-specific parts like fontification
in Dired or the buttonization of links).
</p>

<p>
Portability matters.  For example, in the future I might own a
smartphone, so I prefer not to require Emacs, Org, or some other
executable to access my files on the go.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, I might want to share those files with someone.  If I make
Emacs a requirement, I am limiting my circle to a handful of relatively
advanced users.
</p>

<p>
Please don&rsquo;t misinterpret this: I am using Emacs full-time for my
computing and maintain a growing list of packages for it.  This is just
me thinking long-term.

<h3 id="h:7d2e7b8a-d484-4c1d-8688-17f70f242ad7"><span class="section-number-3">17.4.</span> Why many small files instead of few large ones?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:7d2e7b8a-d484-4c1d-8688-17f70f242ad7">
<p>
I have read that Org favours the latter method.  If true, I strongly
disagree with it because of the implicit dependency it introduces and
the way it favours machine-friendliness over human-readability in terms
of accessing information.  Notes are long-term storage.  I might want to
access them on (i) some device with limited features, (ii) print on
paper, (iii) share with another person who is not a tech wizard.
</p>

<p>
There are good arguments for few large files, but all either prioritize
machine-friendliness or presuppose the use of sophisticated tools like
Emacs+Org.
</p>

<p>
Good luck using <code>less</code> on a generic TTY to read a file with a zillion
words, headings, sub-headings, sub-sub-headings, property drawers, and
other constructs!  You will not get the otherwise wonderful folding of
headings the way you do in Emacs&#x2014;do not take such features for
granted.
</p>

<p>
My point is that notes should be atomic to help the user&#x2014;and
potentially the user&rsquo;s family, friends, acquaintances&#x2014;make sense of
them in a wide range of scenaria.  The more program-agnostic your file
is, the better for you and/or everyone else you might share your
writings with.
</p>

<p>
Human-readability means that we optimize for what matters to us.  If (a)
you are the only one who will ever read your notes, (b) always have
access to good software like Emacs+Org, (c) do not care about printing
on paper, then Denote&rsquo;s model is not for you.  Maybe you need to tweak
some <code>org-capture</code> template to append a new entry to one mega file (I do
that for my Org agenda, by the way, as I explained before about using
the right tool for the job).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:63c2f8d4-79ed-4c55-b3ef-e048a05802c0">
<p>
I have not tested it, but assume that yes, many files will slow down the
agenda.  Consider looking into one of Denote&rsquo;s alternatives, with
<code>org-roam</code> being the obvious choice (<a href="#h:dbb51a1b-90b8-48e8-953c-e2fb3e36981e">Alternatives to Denote</a>).
</p>

<p>
Or, if you want my opinion, decouple your longer-term storage from your
ephemeral to-do list: Denote (and others) can be used for the former,
while you let standard Org work splendidly for the latter&#x2014;that is what
I do, anyway.

<p>
Denote does not sort files and will not reinvent tools that handle such
functionality.  This is the job of the file manager or command-line
executable that lists files.
</p>

<p>
I encourage you to read the manpage of the <code>ls</code> executable.  It will
help you in general, while it applies to Emacs as well via Dired.  The
gist is that you can update on-the-fly the <code>ls</code> flags that Dired uses:
do <code>C-u M-x dired-sort-toggle-or-edit</code> (<code>C-u s</code> by default) and append
<code>--sort=time</code>.  To reverse the order, add the <code>-r</code> flag as well.  The
user option <code>dired-listing-switches</code> sets your default preference.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:764b5e87-cd22-4937-b5fc-af3892d6b3d8">
<p>
Denote does not insert any meta data or heading pertaining to edits in
the file.  I am of the view that these either do not scale well or are
not descriptive enough.  Suppose you use a &ldquo;lastmod&rdquo; heading with a
timestamp: which lines where edited and what did the change amount to?
</p>

<p>
This is where an external program can be helpful.  Use a Version Control
System, such as Git, to keep track of all your notes.  Every time you
add a new file, record the addition.  Same for post-creation edits.
Your VCS will let you review the history of those changes.  For
instance, Emacs&rsquo; built-in version control framework has a command that
produces a log of changes for the current file: <code>M-x vc-print-log</code>,
bound to <code>C-x v l</code> by default.  From there one can access the
corresponding diff output (use <code>M-x describe-mode</code> (<code>C-h m</code>) in an
unfamiliar buffer to learn more about it).  With Git in particular,
Emacs users have the option of the all-round excellent <code>magit</code> package.

In short: let Denote (or equivalent) create notes and link between them,
the file manager organise and provide access to files, search programs
deal with searching and narrowing, and version control software handle
the tracking of changes.

                GNU Free Documentation License
                 Version 1.3, 3 November 2008


 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
