<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Changed the source repository from GitLab to SourceHut:
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/pulsar">https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/pulsar</a>.  Use the mailing list to
start a discussion, report a bug, send a patch, etc.:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/pulsar">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/pulsar</a>.  The GitLab URL will serve
as a mirror from now on (a GitHub mirror is still available and will
remain that way).</li>

<li>Refined how Pulsar behaves in the case of the last line.  Basically,
when the last line cannot be highlighted we want to pulse the one
right above.  Thanks to JD Smith for fine-tuning this behaviour in
merge request 1 over at the GitLab mirror:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/merge_requests/1">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/merge_requests/1</a> (exempt
from the requirement to assign copyright to the Free Software
Foundation as it is below the threshold).</li>

<li>Ensured that the Pulsar effect are limited to the current window when
the buffer is displayed in multiple windows.  This avoids the common
problem of simultaneous highlights in multiple locations, which
confuse rather than inform the user of where the point is.  Thanks to
Aymeric Agon-Rambosson for the contribution in merge request 2 over at
the GitLab mirror:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/merge_requests/2">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/merge_requests/2</a>.  Aymeric
has assigned copyright to the Free Software Foundation.</li>

<li>Wrote a buffer-local and a global minor mode that sets up Pulsar.
This supersedes the old design which had a built-in assumption that
the "pulse line" effect should always be global.  Now the user has
more flexibility.  They may also disable Pulsar on demand.  Note that
pulsar still only triggers its effect for entries in the user option
<code>pulsar-pulse-functions</code>.  Thanks to Rudolf Adamkovič for the feedback
in issue 9 over at the GitLab mirror:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/9">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/9</a>.</li>

<li>Implement the <code>pulsar-highlight-dwim</code> command.  It is like the
<code>pulsar-highlight-line</code> except it also understands regions, be they
regular or rectangular.  Thanks to Mark Barton for the feedback in
issue 13 over at the GitLab mirror:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/13">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/13</a>.</li>

<li>Clarified some technical points in various doc strings and the manual,
such as what is the <code>pulsar-delay</code> and the <code>pulsar-iterations</code>.
Thanks to Rudolf Adamkovič for the feedback in issue 12 over at the
GitLab mirror: <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/12">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/12</a>.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga3bf63b">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fixed an inconsistency that was present when Emacs was running in a
server-client model where the highlight would never pulse but instead
remain fixed in place until another command was invoked.  By default,
the pulse effect should now work for that use-case.  Thanks to Mark
Barton, Petter Storvik, and user kb for their feedback in issue 1:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/1">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/1</a>.</li>

<li>Implemented the <code>pulsar-highlight-line</code> command and abstracted the
relevant code.  Unlike <code>pulsar-pulse-line</code>, it never pulses the
current line.  Instead it keeps the highlight in place until another
command is invoked.  Thanks to Mark Barton for proposing this in
issue 1.</li>

<li>Introduced the user option <code>pulsar-pulse</code> which determines whether
pulsar should use a pulse effect (notwithstanding the aforementioned
new command).  When its value is non-nil (the default) pulsing takes
place.  Thanks to Petter Storvik for suggesting this approach in
issue 1.</li>

<li>Added the user option <code>pulsar-iterations</code> which controls how smooth or
abrupt the pulse effect is.  This complements the existing variable
<code>pulsar-delay</code>.  Both apply only when <code>pulsar-pulse</code> is non-nil.</li>

<li>Wrote the <code>pulsar-generic</code> face and made it the default value of the
<code>pulsar-face</code> user option.  This is consistent with the original
design of a theme-agnostic presentation, though now it ensures that
the <code>:extend</code> attribute is used to stretch the highlight to the edge
of the window (without it and depending on the theme, the highlight
would only reach the last character on the line).</li>

<li>Updated the manual to reflect those changes.</li>

<p>
Initial release of the package.  Please read the manual.
</p>

<p>
The core idea for this package was implemented in the <code>prot-pulse.el</code>
file that is part of <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a> (now deprecated).  I was using it at
least since December 2020.
