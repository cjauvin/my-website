<li>Fixed an inconsistency that was present when Emacs was running in a
server-client model where the highlight would never pulse but instead
remain fixed in place until another command was invoked.  By default,
the pulse effect should now work for that use-case.  Thanks to Mark
Barton, Petter Storvik, and user kb for their feedback in issue 1:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/1">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/1</a>.</li>

<li>Implemented the <code>pulsar-highlight-line</code> command and abstracted the
relevant code.  Unlike <code>pulsar-pulse-line</code>, it never pulses the
current line.  Instead it keeps the highlight in place until another
command is invoked.  Thanks to Mark Barton for proposing this in
issue 1.</li>

<li>Introduced the user option <code>pulsar-pulse</code> which determines whether
pulsar should use a pulse effect (notwithstanding the aforementioned
new command).  When its value is non-nil (the default) pulsing takes
place.  Thanks to Petter Storvik for suggesting this approach in
issue 1.</li>

<li>Added the user option <code>pulsar-iterations</code> which controls how smooth or
abrupt the pulse effect is.  This complements the existing variable
<code>pulsar-delay</code>.  Both apply only when <code>pulsar-pulse</code> is non-nil.</li>

<li>Wrote the <code>pulsar-generic</code> face and made it the default value of the
<code>pulsar-face</code> user option.  This is consistent with the original
design of a theme-agnostic presentation, though now it ensures that
the <code>:extend</code> attribute is used to stretch the highlight to the edge
of the window (without it and depending on the theme, the highlight
would only reach the last character on the line).</li>

<li>Updated the manual to reflect those changes.</li>

Initial release of the package.  Please read the manual.
</p>

<p>
The core idea for this package was implemented in the <code>prot-pulse.el</code>
file that is part of <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a> (now deprecated).  I was using it at
least since December 2020.
