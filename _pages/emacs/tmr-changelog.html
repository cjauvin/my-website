<p>
The gist of TMR's May Release is that TMR is Maintained Rigorously&#x2014;but
enough with The Mostly Recursive acronyms!
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is the first version for which we produce a change log.  The
short story of previous releases: I (Protesilaos) was using and
developing TMR (pronounced as "timer" or "T-M-R") as part of my
personal setup for more than a year until I eventually contributed it
to GNU ELPA.</li>

<li>What was once <code>tmr.el</code> is now split up into purpose-specific files:
<code>tmr.el</code> (core functionality), <code>tmr-tabulated.el</code> (grid view),
<code>tmr-sound.el</code> (audible notifications), and <code>tmr-notification.el</code>
(desktop notifications).</li>

<li>The <code>tmr-with-description</code> command creates a new timer while always
asking for a description.  Whereas the standard <code>tmr</code> command prompts
for a description only when invoked with a prefix argument.</li>

<li>The <code>tmr-clone</code> command copies the duration and optional description
of an existing timer object into a new one.  The operation is
performed without further questions, except if a prefix argument is
supplied: in that case the command will prompt for a duration and, if
the original timer had a description, for one as well.  The default
values of these prompts are those of the original timer.</li>

<li>The <code>tmr-remove-finished</code> deletes all elapsed timers.  This means that
they are removed from the list of available timers and, thus, cannot
be cloned.</li>

<li>The <code>tmr-timer-created-functions</code>, <code>tmr-timer-completed-functions</code>,
and <code>tmr-timer-cancelled-functions</code> are hooks which can be used to
control what happens once a timer is (i) created, (ii) elapses, or
(iii) is cancelled.</li>

<li><p>
Elapsed and running timers are displayed in a grid view with the
command <code>tmr-tabulated-view</code>.  The buffer looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgddf9804">
  Start      End        Finished?  Description
  09:22:43   09:32:43   âœ”         Prepare tea
  09:17:14   09:37:14              Boil water
  09:07:03   09:57:03              Bake bread
</pre></li>

<li>In that grid view, it is possible to create a new timer, or operate on
the one at point to cancel, clone, redescribe, and reschedule it.</li>

<li>Thanks to Christian Tietze for implementing changes to how desktop
notifications are handled.  The overall effect should still be the
same for existing users, though the implementation has been redesigned.</li>

<li>Thanks to Damien Cassou who is now is my co-author due to multiple
contributions for <code>tmr.el</code>, the addition of the grid view, and the
splitting of TMR into numerous files.  Please consult the Git commit
log for the details.  (I still am the maintainer.)</li>

Foundation.  It is required for all packages distributed via GNU ELPA.</li>

TMR was originally <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-10-02-introducing-tmr-el/">announced on my website</a>.  The code was developed as
part of <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs">my dotemacs</a> for several months before it was placed in its own
Git repo.  Even before the Elisp implementation, the core idea existed
as a standalone shell script, which is still part of <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>.
