<li>Version <code>0.1.0</code> (from 2022-06-27) was never built as a package.  The
reason is that the GNU ELPA machinery reads the <code>Version:</code> header of
the main file, not the git tag.  As the original commit in <code>denote.el</code>
included <code>Version: 0.1.0</code>, GNU ELPA rightly tries to build the package
using that reference.  But because at that time I had not yet updated
the Copyright header to name the Free Software Foundation, the package
could not be prepared.  As such, please consider this release to be
the "first formal stable version".  My apologies for the delay,
contrary to what was promised in the last change log entry.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Prospective users are advised to read the manual:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote</a>.  For a video demonstration:

<li>Thanks to Benjamin Kästner for reporting the issue with the GNU ELPA
package on the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C9d600ff0-4fed-2ad7-5dbc-5a194639a045@gmail.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C9d600ff0-4fed-2ad7-5dbc-5a194639a045@gmail.com%3E</a>.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Originally, Denote was designed to only work with notes in a flat
directory.  With code contributions from Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay,
support for subdirectories of the user option <code>denote-directory</code> is
now available.  This covers the case of creating links between notes,
following them, and viewing the backlinks' buffer of the current
entry.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Thanks to Jean-Philippe for the contributions which took place on
the GitHub mirror:

<ul class="org-ul">

</ul></li>

<li>Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay has assigned copyright to the Free Software
Foundation.  This is a prerequisite to contribute code to any
package on the official GNU ELPA archive (and to emacs.git for that
matter).</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The new <code>denote-subdirectory</code> command lets the user select a directory
to place the new note in.  Available candidates are the value of the
<code>denote-directory</code> as well as all of its subdirectories, minus <code>.git</code>.
In future versions, we will consider how to provide a blocklist or a
regexp filter for the user to specify which subdirectories should be
omitted from minibuffer completion.  Please consider providing your
feedback on the technicalities.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay and Shreyas Ragavan for the
feedback in issue 31 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/31">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/31</a>.</li>

<li>Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for fixing a potential problem in
how directories are represented when commands enter the directory
instead of selecting it (again, at the GitHub mirror):
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/35">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/35</a>.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>From 2022-06-24 to 2022-07-03, Denote provided support for links
between Org notes that leveraged the <code>id:</code> hyperlink type.
Discussions on the mailing list and the GitHub mirror revealed the
longer-term problems in our implementation.  In the Annex below, I
provide my detailed opinion on the matter.  The gist is that Denote
does not&#x2014;and will not&#x2014;create <code>id:</code> links between its notes, but
shall use the <code>denote:</code> hyperlink type instead (which works like the
standard <code>file:</code> type).  As the Annex explains, Denote is not org-roam
lite and we try not to engender such false expectations.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Despite the fact that the relevant patches are no longer applicable,
I wish to thank Kaushal Modi and Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for their
contributions over at the GitHub mirror:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/20">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/20</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/28">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/28</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>
The user option <code>denote-date-format</code> controls how the date and time is
recorded in the file's contents (what we call "front matter").  When
nil (the default value), we use a file-type-specific format (also
check the user option <code>denote-file-type</code>):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For Org, an inactive timestamp is used, such as <code>[2022-06-30 Wed 15:31]</code>.</li>

<li>For Markdown, the RFC3339 standard is applied: <code>2022-06-30T15:48:00+03:00</code>.</li>

<li>For plain text, the format is that of ISO 8601: <code>2022-06-30</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the value is a string, ignore the above and use it instead.  The
string must include format specifiers for the date.  These are described
in the doc string of <code>format-time-string</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-date-format</code> supersedes the now obsolete
<code>denote-front-matter-date-format</code>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Peter Prevos and Kaushal Modi for their feedback in issue 27
on the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/27">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/27</a>.
</p></li>

<li>All the faces we define are now declared in the <code>denote-faces.el</code>
file.  The fontification rules are shared by <code>denote-dired-mode</code> and
the backlinks' buffer (invoked by <code>denote-link-backlinks</code> and
controlled by the user option <code>denote-link-fontify-backlinks</code>).  The
current list of faces:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>denote-faces-date</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-delimiter</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-extension</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-keywords</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-subdirectory</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-time</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-title</code></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Named the mailing list address as the <code>Maintainer:</code> of Denote.
Together with the other package headers, they help the user find our
primary sources and/or communication channels.  This change conforms
with work being done upstream in package.el by Philip Kaludercic.  I
was informed about it here:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/%3C875ykl84yi.fsf%40posteo.net%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/%3C875ykl84yi.fsf%40posteo.net%3E</a>.</li>

<li>Fixed how keywords are inferred and combined.  The previous code did not
work properly when the user option <code>denote-infer-keywords</code> was nil.
It would return a list of symbols, with the parentheses, whereas the
file name needs a string where each keyword is delimited by an
underscore.</li>

<li>Simplified how information in the front matter is retrieved.  It fixes
cases where, for example, a special character at the end of the title
was ignored.  Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the patch over at
the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/21">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/21</a>.</li>

<li>Rewrote parts of the manual in the interest of clarity.</li>

commit f35ef05cb451f265213c3aafc1e62c425b1ff043
Author: Protesilaos Stavrou &lt;info@protesilaos.com&gt;
Date:   Sun Jul 3 17:34:38 2022 +0300

    REMOVE support for 'id:' hyperlink types

    The original idea was to support the 'org-id' library on the premise
    that it makes Denote a good Emacs citizen.  However, discussions on the
    mailing list[0] and the GitHub mirror[1] have made it clear to me that
    'org-id' is not consistent with Denote's emphasis on simplicity.

    To support the way 'org-id' works, we will eventually have to develop
    some caching mechanism, just how the org-roam package does it.  This is
    because the variable 'org-id-extra-files' needs to be kept up-to-date
    whenever an operation on a file is performed.  At scale, this sort of
    monitoring requires specialised software.  Such a mechanism is outside
    the scope of Denote---if you need a db, use org-roam which is already
    great.

    [0] &lt;https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C8735fk4y1w.fsf%40hallac.net%3E#%3C877d4un73c.fsf@protesilaos.com%3E&gt;

    [1] &lt;https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/29&gt;

    Quote of what I wrote on the GitHub mirror issue 29:

            [ggjp] This is what I was implying.  That we are, in fact,
            providing an option that is not viable long-term, but keeping
            the option for expert users who will be able to handle this.
            And we should warn about this clearly in the doc of that option.

        [protesilaos] What you write here @ggjp and what @shrysr explained
        tells me that those expert users will need to be real experts.  To
        put it concretely, I am an experienced Emacs user with no
        programming background, who has written several Emacs
        packages (including the modus-themes which are built into Emacs),
        but I have zero knowledge of using a db or of handling things with
        python and the like.  So if I opt in to 'denote-link-use-org-id' I
        will eventually run into problems that my non-existent skills will
        prevent me from solving.  At that point, I will just use org-roam
        which already handles this use-case in a competent way (and has a
        massive community to rely on in case I need further support).

        If each package needs to write its own optimisations and maintain
        its own cache, to me this shows that 'org-id' is not good enough for
        the time being: more work needs to be done in org.git to provide a
        universal solution.

        I wanted to support 'org-id' by default on the premise that Denote
        must be a good Emacs citizen which interoperates with the rest of
        the wider ecosystem.  But if 'org-id' leaves something to be
        desired, then that goal is not worth pursuing: we add complexity to
        our code, offer an option that we cannot genuinely/adequately
        support, and make usage of it contingent on reading the docs and
        having a high level of expertise.

        I think being a good Emacs citizen is a laudable principle.  In this
        case, the right thing to do is to recommend the use of org-roam
        instead of trying to accommodate 'org-id'.  As such, I have now
        changed my mind and think we should remove what we previously added.

        For some context here: the reason I never used org-roam is
        because (i) it is Org-specific whereas I write notes in different
        file types and (ii) I did not want to ever rely on a db or
        equivalent dependency.

Followed up by my explanation:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">&gt; can we not have denote style links to be default for (de)notes - and
&gt; explicitly supported, while if they need to, users can still link
&gt; denote org files via org-id to any other notes/files (and vice versa)
&gt; -- in which case performance + testing for org-id driven linking is
&gt; not within Denote's purview at all?

The formal support for `id:` links was added shortly before the release
of version `0.1.0`.  In the days prior, we supported what you describe
via the manual.  The user could change the `denote-org-front-matter`
variable to include a `PROPERTIES` drawer.  This possibility still
exists, though yesterday I removed the relevant entry from the manual.
This way only the real do-it-yourself experts will go down that path.

My concern here is with managing expectations.  If our Org notes are
superficially the same as org-roam's, an unsuspecting user may think
that Denote is an org-roam lite.  We will thus get issues/requests, such
as those already mentioned in this GitHub repo, about migrating from
org-roam to Denote.  While there are similarities, Denote is not a
minimalist org-roam and I would not like to encourage the idea of
treating the two as interchangeable.

Doing things half-way-through is a way to create false expectations.  A
package on GNU ELPA must be usable by users of all skill levels.  If the
functionality we provide is incomplete and needs to be covered by
user-level tweaks, we are excluding a portion of the user base while
still assuming the maintenance burden.  If someone trusts Denote to,
say, write a 1000 notes, we do not want to surprise them after the fact.
Imagine if the reported issues that triggered this change happened 6
months into one's daily usage of Denote: it wouldn't be nice.

Setting the right expectations is a matter of responsibility: we let the
user make a more informed choice and show respect for their time.  It
also makes it easier for me to keep Denote's scope in check by not
supporting every little extra that Org implements.  The premier Org
extension is org-roam: we do not need another one (or, if we do, I am
not the one to implement it).

* * *

Some comments on the `denote:` hyperlink type for Org as they may be
relevant in this context:

* It is meant to work like the standard `file:` type.  This means that
  it links to a file, while it can also have additional search
  parameters, as explained in the Org manual.  Evaluate:

      (info "(org) Search Options")

* It does not read the front matter, but only the file name.  You can
  create a note as usual, delete all its contents, save it, and try to
  link to it from another note.  It works.

* Exporting now works like the `file:` type for HTML, LaTeX, Texinfo,
  and Markdown.  Technically, it also supports the ASCII backend but the
  format of the output could be tweaked further.

There may be refinements to be made, which is okay as that is part of a
maintainer's duties.

The present entry is intended for early adopters of Denote who may have
not caught up with the latest developments.  Prospective users are
advised to read the manual: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote</a>.  For

<li><p>
The front matter of notes in Org has changed to be compliant with the
standard <code>org-id</code> infrastructure.  A <code>PROPERTIES</code> drawer is added to
the top of the file, which includes an <code>ID</code> property with the value of
the Denote identifier.  Sample:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:          20220610T202537

The front matter of Markdown (YAML or TOML) and plain text files
remains constant.  For completeness, this is how they look:

</pre></li>

<li>The integration with <code>org-id</code> extends to how linking works.  By
default, Denote uses its own custom hyperlink type which starts with
the <code>denote:</code> prefix.  In Org, it works like the <code>file:</code> type.  When
the user option <code>denote-link-use-org-id</code> is non-nil, links from Org
notes to other Org notes will use the standard <code>id:</code> type instead.  As
this is an Org-specific feature, Denote takes care to use the
major-mode-agnostic <code>denote:</code> type when the link targets a non-Org
note.</li>

<li><p>
In Org files the links created by Denote are buttonized automatically.
For Markdown and plain text, we use our own methods.  When a link is
inserted it is buttonized outright.  To buttonize links in existing
notes while visiting them in a buffer, add/evaluate this (it excludes
Org on its own):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (add-hook 'find-file-hook #'denote-link-buttonize-buffer)
</pre>
</div></li>

<li>The generation of the backlinks' buffer now uses the built-in <code>xref</code>
library instead of relying on a hardcoded call to the <code>find</code>
executable.  This means that the <code>denote-link-backlinks</code> command will,
in principle, work properly with all Emacs builds.</li>

<li>Users of Emacs 28 or higher can configure <code>xref-search-program</code> to
change from the default <code>grep</code> to <code>ripgrep</code>, <code>ugrep</code>, or a
user-defined alternative.</li>

<li>This is the first stable release of Denote.  It covers close to 400
commits starting from 2022-06-04.  Denote is the successor to a toy
package of mine, USLS, whose first public version was made available
in early November 2020: <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/usls">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/usls</a>.</li>

<li>Thanks to everyone involved in the development of Denote.  Code
contributions, bug reports, discussion of ideas, are all valuable.
