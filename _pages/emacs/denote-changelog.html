<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Denote rename commands are more user-friendly and featureful.</li>
<li>An optional sorting facility makes it possible to produce a

<p>
[ Remember that you do not need to be a programmer to contribute to
  Denote. Report a bug, make a suggestion, or just describe how you
  want to use this package. Every idea counts and we may implement it
  if we can. ]
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-h:54d803d8-4863-4160-bb2f-3302fb8bff23" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="h:54d803d8-4863-4160-bb2f-3302fb8bff23"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> The rename commands can remove a Denote file name component</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:54d803d8-4863-4160-bb2f-3302fb8bff23">
<p>
The commands we provide to rename files using the Denote file-naming
scheme---<code>denote-rename-file</code>, <code>denote-dired-rename-files</code>, and
<code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files-with-keywords</code>&#x2014;can now remove
Denote file name components. This is done by providing an empty string
at the relevant prompt.
</p>

<p>
For example, to remove the <code>TITLE</code> component from a file called
<code>20231209T110322==sig--title__keywords.ext</code> we provide an empty string
at the title prompt. The end result will look something like this:
<code>20231209T110322==sig__keywords.ext</code>.
</p>

<p>
All prompts now include a hint that leaving them empty will ignore the
given field if it does not exist or remove it if it does exist.
</p>

<p>
Note that you must <b>check how to input an empty string</b> with your
minibuffer user interface of choice. For instance, with the <code>vertico</code>
package you can do that with the <code>M-RET</code> key binding or by selecting
the prompt line directly (notice the counter showing something like
<code>*/5</code> instead of <code>1/5</code>). Please make sure to consult the documentation
of the package you are using as this behaviour is not controlled by
Denote. Vertico, and others like it, selects the first candidate if
you type <code>RET</code> without any input, which is not the same as an empty
string&#x2014;it is the first candidate.
</p>

<p>
Also read the Denote manual on the matter of <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:532e8e2a-9b7d-41c0-8f4b-3c5cbb7d4dca">Renaming files</a>. In short,
we use this facility to name all our files, regardless of file type,
in a consistent way that makes them easier to find (I do this with my
videos, for example, and I do it across my filesystem for all personal
files).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-h:69d85d3b-0200-4cc1-baff-9d59aa0ff57b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="h:69d85d3b-0200-4cc1-baff-9d59aa0ff57b"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> The file-to-be-renamed is easier to read in the minibuffer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:69d85d3b-0200-4cc1-baff-9d59aa0ff57b">
<p>
The commands <code>denote-rename-file</code> and <code>denote-dired-rename-files</code> 
show the name of the file they are operating on in the minibuffer
prompt. This is now produced relative to the current directory,
meaning that instead of <code>/some/rather/long/path/to/file-name.txt</code>
Denote only displays <code>file-name.txt</code>.
</p>

<p>
Our rename commands never move files to another directory, anyway, so
we do not need to remind the user of the entire file system path.
</p>

<p>
To make things easier for users/themes, file names highlighted in
Denote prompts are fontified with either of following faces,
depending on the specifics of the case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>denote-faces-prompt-old-name</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-prompt-new-name</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-prompt-current-name</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
These faces inherit the attributes of basic faces, so they should look
decent without further tweaks across all themes.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-h:5897bcc1-4637-4268-8518-8404d939b4b9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="h:5897bcc1-4637-4268-8518-8404d939b4b9"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Prompts for title, keywords, and signature accept an empty string</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:5897bcc1-4637-4268-8518-8404d939b4b9">
<p>
The prompts defined by Denote that apply to file name components all
accept an empty string. This has the effect of skipping the given
component. For example, we can create a file without a title and
keywords, with the following sequence of actions (I assume you are
using <code>vertico</code> for the minibuffer user interface):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Type <code>M-x denote</code>.</li>
<li>Type <code>M-RET</code> at the title prompt to input an empty string.</li>
<li>Now type <code>M-RET</code> at the keywords prompt for another empty string.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The resulting file name is something like <code>20231209T110950.org</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-h:05aa437b-2fc8-4e01-ac38-ab77baad83af" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="h:05aa437b-2fc8-4e01-ac38-ab77baad83af"><span class="section-number-3">1.4.</span> Dired with sorting and filtering</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:05aa437b-2fc8-4e01-ac38-ab77baad83af">
<p>
The new optional <code>denote-sort.el</code> library provides facilities to sort
Denote files by any of their file name components. Users can benefit
from this facility to produce a filtered and sorted listing of Denote
files with the command <code>denote-sort-dired</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>denote-sort-dired</code> produces a fully fledged Dired buffer. It asks for a
regular expression that matches file names in the <code>denote-directory</code>.
It then prompts for a sort key and finally checks with the user
whether to reverse the order or not.
</p>

<p>
[ Do not be discouraged by the term &ldquo;regular expression&rdquo;. Ordinary
  words work fine. Plus, with Denote&rsquo;s file-naming scheme we have
  semantics such as <code>_keyword</code>, <code>-title</code>, <code>=signature</code>, as explained
  in the manual. This is the whole point of using a thoughtful naming
  scheme. ]
</p>

<p>
The resulting Dired listing is flat, meaning that files inside of
subdirectories are bundled together with those present at the root of
the <code>denote-directory</code>. In this case, files inside of a subdirectory
include the directory component as a prefix. So we have something like
this:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd51b918">
test-subdir/20230320T105950--a-new-note__testing.txt
20231202T095629--rename-works-as-intended__one_test_two.org
</pre>

<p>
I think this is a killer feature, as the fully fledged Dired buffer
allows us to perform all supported operations on our Denote
sorted+filtered files (e.g. change file permissions, move files to
another directory, or open them in an external application).
</p>

<p>
I recorded a video to show how this works:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-12-04-emacs-denote-sort-mechanism/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-12-04-emacs-denote-sort-mechanism/</a>.
</p>

<p>
[ Remember that we can rename any file using the Denote file-naming
  scheme, meaning that our files can include stuff like PDFs and
  videos. Combine this with the concept of &ldquo;silos&rdquo;, which is covered
  in the Denote manual, to organise your long-term storage and
  retrieve it efficiently. ]
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-h:d41009c1-9833-4b28-8240-9666bfd26559" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="h:d41009c1-9833-4b28-8240-9666bfd26559"><span class="section-number-3">1.5.</span> Combine contents of files with an Org dynamic block</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:d41009c1-9833-4b28-8240-9666bfd26559">
<p>
The new <code>denote-files</code> Org dynamic block produces a continuous stream
of file contents. It joins together the contents of files inside the
<code>denote-directory</code> whose name matches the given regular expression.
Optional parameters control whether to include links to those files,
omit their front matter, sort by a given file name component, or tweak
the separator between each file&rsquo;s contents.
</p>

<p>
I produced a video to demonstrate the functionality:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-11-25-emacs-denote-org-dynamic-blocks/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-11-25-emacs-denote-org-dynamic-blocks/</a>.
</p>

<p>
Use the command <code>denote-org-dblock-insert-files</code> to insert such a
block directly at point. Read the Denote manual for the
technicalities: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:f15fa143-5036-416f-9bff-1bcabbb03456">Org dynamic block to insert file contents</a>.
</p>

<p>
[ Videos I do will eventually be out-of-date. The manual is the source
  of truth. ]
</p>

<p>
Bear in mind that this feature is not &ldquo;transclusion&rdquo;. We are simply
printing a copy of the contents of the files in the current buffer.
Changes made to this copy are not reflected in the original files.
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-files</code> Org dynamic block is an excellent way to quickly
collect your thoughts on a given topic. Although dynamic blocks are a
feature of Org, the contents of the files do not need to be in Org
syntax (I write most of my notes in plain text (<code>.txt</code>)).

All Denote Org dynamic blocks make use of <code>denote-sort.el</code> (described

</p>

<p>
Thanks to Glenna D. for suggesting this feature and discussing it with
me. This was done via a private channel and the information is shared
with permission. It is what inspired me to start work on
<code>denote-sort.el</code>, which I then extended to cover Dired, as noted
above.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:144436eb-e674-4052-ac0a-d582b6aa2f53">
<p>
In general, we provide the command <code>denote-link-with-signature</code> to let
the user pick a file that has a signature and link to it. The
description of such a link contains the signature text as well as the
file title. The <code>denote-link-with-signature</code> is distinct from the
standard <code>denote-link</code>, as it allows the user to express intent about
the inclusion of the signature.
</p>

<p>
In Org dynamic blocks for links/backlinks, we make this happen
automatically since there can be no manual intervention to express
intent on a link-by-link basis.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:73e1efaa-2c22-48ee-be46-072b55177c99">
<p>
The file name signature component is now sluggified properly. This
means that multiple words are separated by the equals sign, in
accordance with the Denote file-naming scheme where a word separator
is the same as the given field separator (this is the low-tech feature
that makes Denote files so easy to retrieve without fancy extras).

<p>
Vedang Manerikar fixed two relevant bugs in the &ldquo;rename&rdquo; commands,
while I rewrote internal functions and tests in the interest of consistency. Vedang&rsquo;s patches: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/46790">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/46790</a>.

<p>
[ The &ldquo;signature&rdquo; is a free form component of the file name. Users can
  add anything they want there, such as to use it as a &ldquo;category&rdquo; that
  is different from &ldquo;tags/keywords&rdquo;, or to introduce sequences in
  their notes, or to just have an extra marker for files they need to
  spot quickly. ]

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:79f2fd7e-d5a7-4c78-bce7-f8d21e86e32c">
<p>
There is a section in the manual titled &ldquo;For developers or advanced
users&rdquo;. There we document functions or variables that are
public-facing, meaning that we test and document their behaviour and
encourage others to use them for code they write on top of Denote.
Refer to this section if you are looking to extend Denote. Though you
can also just check the source code, which is designed to be readable
and hackable.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <code>denote-directory-files</code> function gains new functionality that
subsumes that of the now-deprecated functions
<code>denote-directory-files-matching-regexp</code>, <code>denote-all-files</code>,
<code>denote-directory-text-only-files</code>. Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné
Guay for the contribution, which was done in pull request 195 on the
GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/195">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/195</a>.</li>

<li>The font-lock keywords we define are consolidated into a single
variable: <code>denote-faces-file-name-keywords</code> instead of being split
into two variables. This means that we cover all our fontification
needs in the backlinks buffer as well as the <code>denote-dired-mode</code>
with this one point of entry. It also works for <code>denote-sort-dired</code>,
which can include files with their subdirectory component in the
same flat listing.</li>

<li>Use the function <code>denote-retrieve-filename-keywords</code> to extract
keywords from the file name alone, without going into the file
contents.</li>

<li>The <code>denote-retrieve-filename-title</code> function now returns an empty
string if no title is present. Its behaviour is thus consistent with
<code>denote-retrieve-filename-keywords</code> and <code>denote-retrieve-filename-signature</code>.</li>

<li>The <code>denote-retrieve-filename-title</code> will now use the
<code>file-name-base</code> function as a fallback subject to a non-nil
optional argument. This case come into effect when the file does not
have a title component. The new optional argument allows the caller
to handle such cases as they see fit.</li>

<li>The <code>denote-signature-prompt</code> and <code>denote-title-prompt</code> functions
accept an optional <code>DEFAULT-SIGNATURE</code> or <code>DEFAULT-TITLE</code> argument.
Internally, this is used as the <code>INITIAL-INPUT</code> of <code>completing-read</code>
instead of the <code>DEF</code> argument. This matters because we want the
prompt to return an empty string if there is no input, whereas the
presence of <code>DEF</code> means that <code>DEF</code> is returned when the prompt is
empty.</li>

<li>All our functions that interactively match file names with a regular
expression now use the <code>denote-files-matching-regexp-prompt</code>
function. When called from Lisp, it takes a <code>REGEXP</code> argument as
well as an optional <code>PROMPT-TEXT</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For the purposes of this release cycle, I am not documenting the
points of entry provided by <code>denote-sort.el</code>. It is a new feature that
I may eventually incorporate in <code>denote.el</code>. If you are interested in
the functionality (e.g. to have more elaborate sorting algorithms),
please take a look at the source code and then let us discuss the
implementation details.

major mode they belong to. This means that <code>M-X</code> (note the capital
X), which calls <code>execute-extended-command-for-buffer</code> by default,
will only show those commands in the relevant context.</li>

<li>Made internal refinements and simplified the implementation of a few
functions. This is important work to keep the code base clean and

I will give a ~1 week pause on Denote development before making any
feature changes. This is to ensure that we catch possible bugs and
push fixes right away. If there are other changes in place, it is not
possible to make point updates of this sort, as we must first wait for
the new features to be tested in real-world scenaria.

<p>
The general theme of this release is improvements to the quality of
life with Denote. While these release notes and the overall
documentation are comprehensive, make no mistake: Denote can be used
with <code>M-x denote</code>, <code>M-x denote-link</code>, <code>M-x denote-backlinks</code>, <code>M-x
denote-rename-file</code>. These have been rock solid from the beginning.
Everything else is for more specialised workflows.

<p>
I hope to produce a companion video to this changelog in the coming
days. Though I am still reeling from the injury to my left hand (I
wrote all this to not delay the package any longer). Please check back

[ Remember to consult the manual whenever you have a question about
  Denote. It is comprehensive and, in my opinion, a paradigm of how
  free software should be done for the benefit of users. I document
  everything in detail and am eager to continue this way. If something
  is unclear, contact me in person, use the mailing list, or open an
  issue on the GitHub/GitLab mirror. I do not check other fora or
  media and will thus not help you there. If you are writing custom
  code, remember to read the doc strings. I write them for you too. ]

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:a086d1d2-adb3-4151-a7af-813d79b4b3dc">
<p>
This user option enabled the use of keywords that consisted of
multiple words. Those would be separated by hyphens. Such keywords do
not work as Org <code>#+filetags</code> and also mess up with the neat search
semantics of Denote&rsquo;s file-naming scheme where a hyphen prefix
anchors the query to the <code>TITLE</code> component of the name.
</p>

<p>
Users who absolutely need multi-word keywords are encouraged to use
the new <code>denote-file-name-letter-casing</code> option. More below.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:29319b8a-698b-4a1c-bab4-7b106a623de8">
<p>
By default, Denote downcases all components of the file name. The user
option <code>denote-file-name-letter-casing</code> provides granular control over
this behaviour.
</p>

<p>
The value it accepts is an alist where each element is a cons cell of
the form <code>(COMPONENT . METHOD)</code>. The manual, or the variable&rsquo;s doc
string, cover the details. The gist is that we can now instruct Denote
to accept input verbatim, such as because we want to apply a
<code>camelCase</code> convention or variants thereof.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example, where we downcase the title, but preserve the
letter casing of the signature and keyword components with this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq denote-file-name-letter-casing
      '((title . downcase)
        (signature . verbatim)
        (keywords . verbatim)
        (t . downcase)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Users of the now-deprecated <code>denote-allow-multi-word-keywords</code> are
encouraged to implement a letter casing convention with the help of
this new user option.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:5bcdc4b8-ecba-44d7-accc-0b26657aa29b">
<p>
Denote provides several commands with a &ldquo;do or create&rdquo; logic. For
example, the <code>denote-open-or-create</code> prompts for a file to visit: if
something matches the user&rsquo;s input, it is visited in a buffer,
otherwise a new note is created with the given input. Same for
<code>denote-link-or-create</code>, mutatis mutandis.
</p>

<p>
Before, the &ldquo;&#x2026; or create&rdquo; step did not make it obvious how the
previous search terms could be reused. Whereas now those are set as
the default minibuffer value at the title prompt, meaning that typing
<code>RET</code> at the empty prompt will use that value, while <code>M-n</code>
(<code>next-history-element</code> with default settings) will put the text into
the prompt for further editing.
</p>

<p>
I will answer this because I get asked about it: we still refrain from
creating the new note outright because the search terms are not
necessarily suitable for a new title. Remember that Denote&rsquo;s file name
is optimised for searching: <code>-word</code> is specific to the title, <code>_word</code>
to the keywords, and <code>=word</code> to the signature. Combine this with the
<code>orderless</code> package and you frequently type something like <code>_jou -he</code>
to match a file with the <code>journal</code> keyword and the word <code>hesitation</code>
in its title.
</p>

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> some minibuffer completion User Interfaces preselect
the first completion candidate, which is not always the same as the
default value. Check with your UI of choice how to pass a default
value and/or provide an empty input. For example, with the <code>vertico</code>
package one can move up from the first candidate to select the prompt
itself (the counter switches from <code>1/N</code> to <code>*/N</code>).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-h:6f475151-9d64-4dfb-8c59-694c93d56ce8">
<p>
As part of the wider &ldquo;do or create&rdquo; feature set, Denote provides the
option to run a specific note-creating command instead of just using
the standard <code>denote</code> one. For example, it is possible to call the
<code>denote-subdirectory</code> command to pick a subdirectory of the
<code>denote-directory</code> for the new note. Commands providing this facility
are <code>denote-open-or-create-with-command</code> and <code>denote-link-after-creating-with-command</code>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:429847c8-ebf4-4b23-a597-5276309ef61a">
<p>
All Denote minibuffer prompts come with their own history. This means
that <code>M-p</code> (<code>previous-history-element</code>) and <code>M-n</code>
(<code>next-history-element</code>) always return relevant input.
</p>

<p>
The title and signature prompts now reuse their input history to
provide completion. This means that the user can quickly access
previous inputs, either to pass them directly or edit them further
before inputting them.
</p>

<p>
[ Use the built-in <code>savehist-mode</code> to persist histories across sessions. ]
</p>

<p>
Remember to check with your minibuffer UI on how to input empty
values at the prompt, should you ever need to do so.
</p>

<p>
For posterity, I first implemented this in commit <code>0d855bb</code>. However,
it did not work with the default minibuffer because the <code>SPC</code> key
performs completion (popping up the Completions buffer). So users
could not easily input an arbitrary string for the title/signature. I
thus reverted that commit in <code>9f692cb</code>.
</p>

<p>
[ The bug was reported by Suhail Singh on the mailing list:
  <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C652d82c0.c80a0220.e6282.dc47%40mx.google.com%3E#%3C65392fa6.050a0220.da61c.0ac8@mx.google.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C652d82c0.c80a0220.e6282.dc47%40mx.google.com%3E#%3C65392fa6.050a0220.da61c.0ac8@mx.google.com%3E</a>. ]
</p>

<p>
Stefan Monnier suggested the use of the <code>minibuffer-with-setup-hook</code>,
which lets us disable <code>SPC</code> completion for the purposes of these
functions. This is most welcome as the functionality is nice to have.
Stefan&rsquo;s feedback was provided on the emacs-devel mailing list:

Denote&rsquo;s value proposition is its efficient file-naming scheme that
makes it easier to retrieve files even with rudimentary search tools.
We provide several commands to rename existing files according to this
scheme. The underlying file type does not matter (e.g. I use Denote to
name my video files).

which one is current.

better communicate what it does. In short, this is a quick way to add
the given keywords to a list of files, converting them to the Denote
file-naming scheme in case they are not already using it. For the full
interactive power, use the aforementioned <code>denote-dired-rename-files</code>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:9ceaf432-797c-46e5-aaf8-d7180ad66689">
<p>
Emacs can seamlessly visit a <code>.gpg</code> or <code>.age</code> file. Denote has nothing
to do with encryption, though it takes care to recognise the
underlying file type and to perform its work accordingly. However,
prior versions of Denote contained a bug in how file extensions were
handled: it would keep the encryption extension but remove the file
type extension before it (so &ldquo;.org.gpg&rdquo; would wrongly become &ldquo;.gpg&rdquo;).
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Jens Östlund for reporting a bug with <code>denote-keywords-add</code>
on an encrypted file, which prompted me to investigate this further
and fix the issue holistically. This was done in issue 172 on the
GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/172">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/172</a>.
</p>

<p>
Interested parties are advised to check the two new public functions,
<code>denote-get-file-extension</code> and <code>denote-get-file-extension-sans-encryption</code>,
for the implementation details. In short, we had a problem with all
operations that needed to retrieve the file extension when that
included an encryption component.

<p>
The manual of Denote has long provided code samples to achieve
particularised results. Among those were snippets to streamline the
use of Denote for journaling.
</p>

<p>
To make things even easier for users, we now have the
<code>denote-journal-extras.el</code>. It consolidates the rich corpus of
documented snippets into an easy-to-use and formally maintained
package. Thanks to Vedang Manerikar for providing the impetus for this
process. This was done on the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/43255#%3C20230803170935.60833-2-ved.manerikar@gmail.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/43255#%3C20230803170935.60833-2-ved.manerikar@gmail.com%3E</a>.

<p>
The new file is optional. It can be loaded thus:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(require 'denote-journal-extras)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The main idea is to quickly create journal entries. Check the manual
for the details, including the commands to use and the variables to
configure: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:4a6d92dd-19eb-4fcc-a7b5-05ce04da3a92">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:4a6d92dd-19eb-4fcc-a7b5-05ce04da3a92</a>.

<p>
Thanks to Kostas Andreadis for working on a comment I had included in
a working state of the code about the inclusion of templates. Kostas
made it possible to use the Denote template prompt (per the
<code>denote-templates</code> user option) as part of the creation of a new
journal entry. This was done in pull request 173 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/173">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/173</a>. The change is less

<code>denote-journal-extras-title-format</code> did not accept a <code>nil</code> value (as
it should). This was done in issue 176 on the GitHub mirror:

<p>
Hi folks,
</p>

<p>
I have just updated the denote-explore package:
<a href="https://github.com/pprevos/denote-explore">https://github.com/pprevos/denote-explore</a>
</p>

<p>
It does three things:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Summary statistics: Count and visualise keywords and note types</li>
<li>Random walks: Generate new ideas using serendipity</li>
<li>Network visualisation: Visualise your Denote network of links</li>
</ol>

<p>
It contains a rudimentary network visualisation function, relying
on the R language. I will need some D3.js expertise to improve the
visualisation.
</p>

<p>
There should be a way to generate the basic network structure just
using Elisp and feeding a JSON to D3.js.
</p>

<p>
Regards
</p>

<p>
P:)

<li>During this release cycle, I made lots of changes that in one way or
another related to the <code>denote-file-prompt</code>. It was relying on a
<code>project.el</code> mechanism that did not allow us to do everything we
needed. I have thus arranged for it to use the standard
<code>completing-read</code> mechanism. There are subtle differences in
behaviour, though the core idea is the same. This change fixes a few
not-so-obvious bugs. Interested parties are advised to refer to the
message in commit <code>50d1bbdf1e8ffe0f449f2f5da02f9b70322fff7d</code>.</li>

<li>All commands that use the <code>denote</code> function internally (i.e.
anything that creates a new note) call the
<code>denote-after-new-note-hook</code> as part of their work. This hook is
mostly intended for advanced users who want to do something after a
new note is produced.</li>

<li>The <code>menu-bar-mode</code> submenu of Denote is now positioned where it
should be after the &ldquo;Tools&rdquo;. Thanks to Noboru Ota for the patch:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/44738">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/44738</a>.</li>

<li>The <code>menu-bar-mode</code> entry of Denote includes the new commands. This
is a nice way to discover more of what Denote can do.</li>

<li>The commands <code>denote-backlinks-prev</code> and <code>denote-backlinks-next</code> are
only meant to be used inside the Denote backlinks buffer. As such,
they now produce an error when called elsewhere (I wish I could hide
them from <code>M-x</code> altogether).</li>

<li>The <code>denote-extract-keywords-from-front-matter</code> always returns a
list, thus avoiding an erroneous case. Thanks to Vedang Manerikar
for fixing the bug: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/46420">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/46420</a>.</li>

<li><p>
The <code>T</code> in the Denote identifier component now has its own face:
<code>denote-faces-time-delimiter</code>. This is used by the backlinks buffer
and the <code>denote-dired-mode</code>. The idea is to introduce a subtle
distinction between the date and time constituents of the
identifier. Those who want the <code>T</code> to be the same colour as the rest
of the identifier, can make the <code>denote-faces-time-delimiter</code>
inherit the <code>denote-faces-date</code>. For example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (set-face-attribute 'denote-faces-time-delimiter nil :inherit 'denote-faces-date)
</pre>

<code>denote--extract-title-from-file-history</code>. Thanks to ezchi for
bringing this matter to my attention. It was done in issue 166 on
the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/166">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/166</a>.</li>

<li>A link can be created from inside an <code>org-capture</code> buffer. This
means that we can call <code>denote-link</code> (and related) while capturing a
new note with <code>org-capture</code>. Thanks to Peter Smith for reporting the
bug in issue 186 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/186">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/186</a>.</li>

<li>We stopped using <code>vc-rename-file</code> to rename files. The reason is
that it requires the buffer to be saved, but we do not want that
after modifying the front matter because we want to give the user a
chance to confirm what happened. Thanks to Frédéric Willem for
reporting the problem in issue 185 on the GitHub mirror:

This is the second major version of Denote, close to one year after
its initial release.  The video demo I did back then remains relevant,
even though lots of details have changed.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:a3a9e14d-4132-47c0-a23c-cb008a141668">
<p>
It is now possible to create notes that include a <code>SIGNATURE</code> field in
their file name.  Either use the convenience command <code>denote-signature</code>
or configure the user option <code>denote-prompts</code> to affect what the <code>denote</code>
command should prompt for.
</p>

<p>
Signatures are arbitrary strings of characters that enable the user to
further qualify their documents.  One possible workflow is to write
relational notes, such that <code>1a1</code> is the first extension of another
note with a <code>1a</code> signature.
</p>

<p>
The design of the <code>SIGNATURE</code> field is consistent with the Denote
file-naming scheme.  The field separator is the double equals sign
(<code>==</code>), while words that comprise the signature are joined together by
a single equals sign.  As such, the user can prefix a search with an
equals sign to match words in the <code>SIGNATURE</code>, just as they would use
dashes for the <code>TITLE</code> and underscores for the <code>KEYWORDS</code>.
</p>

<p>
[ Read the manual for the technicalities of the Denote file-naming
  scheme.  This is not limited to &ldquo;notes&rdquo;: any file can be named
  accordingly (I do it with my videos, for example). ]
</p>

<p>
Signatures are not included in a file&rsquo;s front matter.  This is a
strategic decision to preserve backward compatibility, while not
introducing a feature that has not enjoyed widespread usage.  I want
to make signatures behave the same as the rest of the file name
fields, though I am interested to learn how users employ them in their
workflow.
</p>

<p>
The signature extension was discussed at length on the GitHub mirror
in issue 115: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/115">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/115</a>.

issue 147: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/147">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/147</a>.
</p>

<p>
Read the original announcement:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-03-20-emacs-denote-signature-feature/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-03-20-emacs-denote-signature-feature/</a>.
</p>

<p>
As part of the development, I fixed a case where
<code>denote-rename-file-using-front-matter</code> would fail if it could not
find a signature
</p>

<p>
The idea is that we want the command to behave the way it always did
when the file has no signature and to preserve the signature when it
is present.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to relict for reporting the issue on the mailing list:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:d24645a3-ad02-450c-b3d7-af7802aa0b26">
<p>
Denote provides commands to rename an existing file to one that
follows the Denote file-naming scheme (videos, PDFs, other text
documents, &#x2026;).  Check, for example, the <code>denote-rename-file</code> and
<code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files</code>.  The idea is to make everything
easier to search.
</p>

<p>
In prior versions, these commands could produce duplicate identifiers
if the modification date of the underlying files was the same.  Such a
scenario occurs when the files are modified programmatically, as with
the <code>touch</code> command or the various <code>git</code> operations.
</p>

<p>
Denote will now take care to increment the identifier until it becomes
unique within the current scope.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-h:6ea998be-83dd-4c67-945c-11011372818f">
<p>
The <code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files</code> now accepts two optional
arguments.  When called interactively, these are interpreted as a
single or double universal prefix argument (<code>C-u</code> by default, though
do <code>M-x where-is</code> and search for <code>universal-argument</code>).
</p>

<p>
The first argument, named <code>SKIP-FRONT-MATTER-PROMPT</code>, skips the &ldquo;yes
or no&rdquo; prompt requested at the outset of the operation, passing to it
an affirmative response.  Thanks to Jay Rajput for asking the question
that inspired me to implement this.  It was done in issue 155 on the
GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/155">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/155</a>.
</p>

<p>
The second argument, named <code>NO-UNIQUE-ID-CHECK</code>, will not perform any
checks for potential duplicate identifiers.  The default is to check
for duplicates and increment them such that they become unique.  The
reason this optional argument exists is for those who want to speed up
the process, perhaps because they know ahead of time all identifiers
will be unique or do not care about them.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Bruno Boal for refining how the prefix argument is
processed.  The patch was sent via a private channel.  The change is
small and thus does not require copyright assignment to the Free
Software Foundation.

There is a known issue where the <code>menu-bar-mode</code> entry is positioned

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:acf95a79-3c45-423d-a88f-d6eed7fa5387">
<p>
Originally, Denote was organised as a collection of several files,
each of which had its own prefix like <code>denote-dired.el</code>, and
<code>denote-link.el</code>.  This arrangement was deemed surplus to requirements
and all core code was consolidated in <code>denote.el</code>.  An artefact of
that design was the presence of symbols that retained their admittedly
awkward names, like the command <code>denote-link-backlinks</code> or
<code>denote-link-add-missing-links</code>.
</p>

<p>
All such commands are deprecated.  They are replaced with more
discoverable names.  The deprecation is done in such a way that the
old names are aliases for the new ones, but the user is warned not to
rely on them.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:98f6b10a-ea29-49d1-8d3f-e2f0409f4c8f">
<p>
The Denote file-naming scheme is designed to be a low-tech way of
embedding information in files, making them easier to find.  A
downside is that the names are longer than <code>blah.txt</code> and so the
default Emacs behaviour is to derive a buffer name from the file name.
</p>

<p>
The new optional <code>denote-rename-buffer.el</code> provides a minor mode to
automatically rename the buffer of an existing file, such that it
reflects the file&rsquo;s <code>TITLE</code> field.  Users must enable
<code>denote-rename-buffer-mode</code>.
</p>

<p>
The renaming procedure is controlled by the user option
<code>denote-rename-buffer-function</code>.  By default, it provides the means to
rename using (i) the title, (ii) the identifier, or (iii) a custom
function that returns a string.  Experienced users can refer to
<code>denote-rename-buffer-with-title</code> to draw inspiration on the design of
such a function.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:113820c4-7a6f-4126-9a44-92bfa59744e2">
<p>
Denote provides a feature to isolate files in to their own silos, each
of which functions as its own <code>denote-directory</code> variable.  The
technicalities are explained in the manual.  Silos have proven to be a
valuable aspect of file management and I have thus expanded their
scope to work as fully fledged directory trees.  This means that we no
longer assume a silo to be a flat directory listing, but instead
recognise any subdirectories inside of it.

The idea is to have short keywords and then use more than one, if
necessary.  We do not want to encourage the habit of long keywords
that become overly specific, while we want to avoid the use of
dashes as delimited in the file name&rsquo;s <code>KEYWORDS</code> field.

Technically, this changes the default value of the user option
<code>denote-allow-multi-word-keywords</code>.  Users who preferred the old

Denote can leverage the Org feature of &ldquo;dynamic blocks&rdquo; to produce

The function <code>denote-get-path-by-id</code> is refactored to accept any file

was always able to create <code>denote:</code> Org link types to, for example,
<code>jpg</code> files but <code>denote-get-path-by-id</code> was refusing to resolve the

The change was not trivial.  It was followed up by a patch from Noboru
Ota (nobiot) which elaborated on the conditionality.  Quoting from
commit <code>9ce9a24</code>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
fix(denote-get-path-by-id): #135
</p>

<p>
Reference: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/135">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/135</a>
</p>

<p>
This patch change function &rsquo;denote-get-path-by-id&rsquo; to allow for the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A single ID points to multiple files with different extensions</li>
<li>Denote needs to find a single file out of the multiple files</li>
<li>This is not necessarily a user error (export an Org file to an HTML)</li>
<li>Denote should let user decide their &ldquo;primary&rdquo; file extension</li>
</ul>

<p>
The case the patch is intended to fix goes something like this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You have 20230216_<sub>mynotes</sub>&#x2013;tag.org.</li>
<li>You export it to 20230216_<sub>mynotes</sub>&#x2013;tag.html.</li>
<li>Both files are in denote-directory</li>
<li>This means you have two files with the same ID with different
extensions denote-link-find-file, denote-link-find-backlink, and xref
integration might find the html file INSTEAD OF the .org file</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is because html is earlier in the alphabetical order than
org. Because the function uses seq-find, it will find the .html file
first and returns it.

<li>Revised <code>denote-link-return-{links,backlinks}</code> to not produce a
<code>user-error</code>.  The errors are reserved for the interactive
functions. The others are for developers. Thanks to Elias Storms for
bringing this matter to my attention:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/commit/694c1517be73949edbc3993c105c764da8e2571f#commitcomment-112677876">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/commit/694c1517be73949edbc3993c105c764da8e2571f#commitcomment-112677876</a>.</li>

<li>Refrained from trying to find forward links in non-text-files.  If a
file extension is not in <code>denote-file-types</code>, we have no way of
parsing or finding outgoing links in it. This change checks for the
file extension early on in &rsquo;when-let*&rsquo; block and avoids opening the
file which is a relatively costly operation (and would fail finding
links anyway).  Thanks to relict007 for the patch.  This was done on
the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87r0riffdx.fsf%40kotlak.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87r0riffdx.fsf%40kotlak.com%3E</a>
The change is small and thus does not require copyright assignment
to the Free Software Foundation.</li>

<li>Explained how to troubleshoot Denote.  Refer to the section in the
manual titled &ldquo;Troubleshoot Denote in a pristine environment.&rdquo;
While this is about Denote, the skills apply to all Emacs packages.</li>

<li>Ensured backlinks get correct <code>denote-directory</code> path.  The
backlinks buffer will now get the correct path when it is generated
inside a silo.  This is related to issue 129 reported by hapst3r on
the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/129">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/129</a>.
The change is necessary because <code>.dir-locals.el</code> do not work for
buffers, so we must get the value from the file that calls
<code>denote-link-backlinks</code>.</li>

<li>Added missing underscore from examples in exporting section.  Thanks
to Peter Prevos for bringing this matter to my attention:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87fs8b85tq.fsf%40prevos.net%3E#%3C87lehiuxfo.fsf@protesilaos.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87fs8b85tq.fsf%40prevos.net%3E#%3C87lehiuxfo.fsf@protesilaos.com%3E</a>.</li>

<li>Made the command <code>denote-open-or-create</code> work with an empty
<code>denote-directory</code>.  The <code>denote-file-prompt</code> would throw an error
before.  The correct behaviour is to proceed to the &ldquo;Create&rdquo; phase
if the <code>denote-directory</code> is empty.  Thanks to user drcxd for
reporting the bug in issue 131 on the GitHub mirror and for testing
my sample code: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/131">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/131</a>.</li>

<li>Documented how to use tree-based file prompt on demand.  This is my
solution to a request made by Mirko Hernandez on the possible use of
the old Denote file prompt.  It is better not to introduce a user
option for this case, nor to keep multiple variants of the
<code>denote-file-prompt</code> in denote.el, as we want to keep things simple.
Mirko&rsquo;s feedback was provided in issue 121 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/121">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/121</a>.</li>

<li>Added the variable <code>denote-user-enforced-denote-directory</code>.  This is
intended for users who write custom code to extend Denote.  The
value of this variable should be <code>let</code> bound around calls to the
function <code>denote-directory</code>, thus overriding its return value.  This
was discussed on the mailing list and then introduced by Vedang
Manerikar in commit <code>977c757</code>, with further changes by me in
<code>20ddc97</code>: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/41776">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/41776</a>.
Vedang has assigned copyright to the Free Software Foundation.</li>

<li><p>
Fixed <code>my-denote-org-extract-subtree</code> section of the documentation.
This is part of some sample code that is not part of <code>denote.el</code>,
but we provide as a convenience/inspiration for interested parties.
</p>

<p>
The provided function did not work correctly.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Tags are extracted before deleting the region from the source file.</li>
<li>The function <code>org-end-of-subtree</code> is called to calculate the
point we should delete up to.  The previously used function
<code>org-entry-end-position</code> ends at the first sub-heading under the
tree, which is not what we want.  Instead, we want to cut the
whole subtree.</li>
<li>The date information available in the subtree is retained.  We
look for three common places for this information: the <code>CREATED</code>
or <code>DATE</code> properties in the <code>PROPERTIES</code> drawer, and the <code>CLOSED</code>
cookie at the element level itself.</li>
</ol>

Thanks to Vedang Manerikar for the contribution:

</p></li>

<li>Removed the dependency on the built-in <code>xdg</code> library and updated the
default value of the user option <code>denote-directory</code>.  The reason is
that XDG is a Linux standard that does not work on other operating
systems, according to private feedback I received.</li>

<li><p>
Fixed a regression for <code>M-p</code> (<code>previous-history-element</code>) in &ldquo;do or
create&rdquo; commands.  Read the doc string of the commands
<code>denote-open-or-create</code> or <code>denote-link-or-create</code> for how this is
supposed to work.  In short:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Invoke the &ldquo;do or create&rdquo; command.</li>
<li>Type something that does not match a file.</li>
<li>In the following title prompt, hit <code>M-p</code> to bring back the last input.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I realised there was a regression when I read issue 152 on the
GitHub mirror, which was created by user &ldquo;ustcpxy&rdquo;:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/152">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/152</a>.  The issue is
about skipping the file title prompt.
</p></li>

<li>Simplified the internal <code>denote--buffer-file-names</code>.  Thanks to Adam
Růžička for noting that my change was not compatible with older
Emacs versions, and for preparing the change.  This was discussed in
pull request 158 on the GitHub mirror, with my suggestion to not use
<code>seq-filter</code> as it affected the return value:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/158">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/158</a>. The change is
below the 15 line limit, meaning that Adam does have to assign
copyright to the Free Software Foundation.</li>

<li>Documented custom code in the manual on how to interactively select
a silo.  I am providing this in response to a request from GitHub
user rbenit68.  The discussion took place in issue 127 on the GitHub
mirror, with the participation of Mirko Hernandez:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/127">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/127</a>. The custom code
I provide is the expanded version of an idea put forth by Mirko, to
whom I am thankful.</li>

<li>Fixed an outdated reference in the <code>denote-file-types</code> doc string.
Thanks to user doolio for spotting the error and reporting it in
issue 139 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/139">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/139</a>.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:bc0e173a-3b9f-427c-9fb0-d435a5ef127e">
<p>
With the help of Noboru Ota (nobiot), we realised that Denote was
broken on Emacs 27 for quite a while.  The fact that we received no
feedback about it suggests that this change is the best course of
action going forward.  Discussion:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C86r0yvzm12.fsf%40nobiot.com%3E#%3C86sfja78ik.fsf@nobiot.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C86r0yvzm12.fsf%40nobiot.com%3E#%3C86sfja78ik.fsf@nobiot.com%3E</a>
</p>

<p>
Emacs 27 lacks certain Xref facilities that we need for the
backlinking facility.  It was holding us back for no good reason,
while also adding to the maintenance burden.
</p>

<p>
If you are using Denote on Emacs 27 and things are working for you,
there is no need to update the package.  Do it when you also upgrade
Emacs to a newer version.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-h:dafbdbae-36f1-487a-94c8-2762568a766e" class="outline-3">

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:dafbdbae-36f1-487a-94c8-2762568a766e">
<p>
By default, the generic backlinks&rsquo; buffer, which can be displayed with
the command <code>denote-link-backlinks</code> (alias <code>denote-link-show-backlinks-buffer</code>),
only shows the file names of the linked notes.
</p>

<p>
We have made it possible to produce a more informative view by showing
the context of the link and also listing all links per file.  This is
done by setting the user option <code>denote-backlinks-show-context</code> to a
non-nil value.
</p>

<p>
To illustrate the difference, this is the default backlinks&rsquo; buffer:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org0d7107d">

<p>
And this is the one with <code>denote-backlinks-show-context</code> enabled:
</p>

Thanks to Noboru Ota (nobiot) for implementing this feature.  We

Denote now includes the <code>denote-org-dblock</code> library.  Activate it
thus:

A dynamic block gets its contents by evaluating a given function,
depending on the type of block.  The type of block and its parameters
are stated in the opening <code>#+BEGIN</code> line of the block.  Typing <code>C-c
C-c</code> with point on that line runs the function, with the given
arguments, and populates the block&rsquo;s contents accordingly.
</p>

<p>
What Denote has is ways to write blocks that produce a list of links
matching a given regular expression while conforming with some other
parameters.  The manual explains how to use this powerful feature
(which is necessarily specific to the Org file type):

<p>
Denote was already using Xref internally but has now gained more
capabilities which help it find files more effectively.  With the help
of Emacs&rsquo; standard project library, all file-related prompts (e.g. to
add a link) search all items in the <code>denote-directory</code> regardless of
whether the user is in a subdirectory or not.
</p>

<p>
All Denote commands benefit from this refactoring.  One such request
to &ldquo;Make <code>denote-open-or-create</code> work better across subfolders&rdquo; was
made in issue 114 on the GitHub mirror:

functionality:

I will not document the new user option <code>denote-modules</code> right now as
my ongoing job search prevented me from exploring the full potential
of this feature.  I promise to do it for the next version of Denote
and update the manual accordingly.  Nevertheless, the doc string of
<code>denote-modules</code> already provides all one needs to get started.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:5a003d44-7ad0-4c92-b908-ec7cf016b2dd">
<p>
The commands <code>denote-open-or-create</code>, <code>denote-link-or-create</code> first
prompt for an existing note.  If they find it, they act on it,
otherwise they prompt for the creation of a new note to operate on.
</p>

<p>
At the first prompt, it is common to use regular expressions and
out-of-order pattern matching (such as with the <code>orderless</code> package),
so the input can be something like <code>_test ^2022 some title</code>, which we
obviously don&rsquo;t want to automatically reuse as the new note&rsquo;s actual
title.
</p>

<p>
To this end, and to accommodate all workflows, we leverage Emacs&rsquo;
minibuffer history to make the last input accessible with <code>M-p</code> at the
minibuffer prompt (<code>M-x previous-history-element</code>).  The text is
available for further editing before it is submitted as the new note&rsquo;s
title.  Simple, effective, and flexible!

<p>
Denote provides the user option <code>denote-file-type</code> which specifies the
file type to use for new notes.  Options include Org mode (the
default), Markdown+YAML, Markdown+TOML, and plain text.  Furthermore,
there exists the convenience command <code>denote-type</code> (alias
<code>denote-create-note-using-type</code>) which prompts for a file type to use
when creating a new note (I normally write in plain text, but
sometimes switch to Org or Markdown).
</p>

<p>
The variable <code>denote-file-types</code> (which is NOT a user option)
specifies all the parameters of what a &ldquo;file type&rdquo; means, such as how
to format its front matter, what style of date+time to use, which file
type extension to write, how to rename the file, what style of link to
apply, and so on.  Advanced users can now edit this variable to either
register new file types or redefine the behaviour of existing ones.
Read this comprehensive guide on how to do it:

</p>

<p>
I repeat: this is for advanced users or, anyhow, for those who are
prepared to maintain some custom code in their setup.  The guide is
accessible though and I am always willing to help anyone in need of
assistance.

<p>
The <code>denote-file-types</code> were introduced by Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay in
pull request 89 at the GitHub mirror and were part of Denote version
0.6.0: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/89">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/89</a>.  I have made
lots of changes since then to make all parts of Denote work with it
and to parameterise its various facets.

The user option <code>denote-excluded-directories-regexp</code> instructs all
Denote functions that read or check file/directory names to omit
directories that match the given regular expression.  The regexp needs
to match only the name of the directory, not its full path.
</p>

<p>
Affected operations include file prompts and functions that return the
available files in the <code>denote-directory</code>.  File prompts are used by
several commands, such as <code>denote-link</code> and <code>denote-subdirectory</code>.
Functions that check for files include <code>denote-directory-files</code> and
<code>denote-directory-subdirectories</code>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:ff16633f-5fb8-4935-9e2f-044ec998d3f7">
<p>
Peter Prevos has produced the <code>citar-denote</code> package which makes it
possible to write notes on BibTeX entries with the help of the <code>citar</code>
package.  These notes have the citation&rsquo;s unique key associated with
them in the file&rsquo;s front matter.  They also get a configurable keyword
in their file name, making it easy to find them in Dired and/or
retrieve them with the various Denote methods.
</p>

<p>
With <code>citar-denote</code>, the user leverages standard minibuffer completion
mechanisms (e.g. with the help of the <code>vertico</code> and <code>embark</code> packages)
to manage bibliographic notes and access those notes with ease.  The
package&rsquo;s documentation covers the details: <a href="https://github.com/pprevos/citar-denote/">https://github.com/pprevos/citar-denote/</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Peter Prevos for developing this package and for mentioning

The <code>denote-link-add-missing-links</code> is a companion to what we
already provide to produce a list of links to Denote files matching
a regular expression (the <code>denote-link-add-links</code>).  This new
command adds links that are not already present in the current file.
So if you have a metanote that references, say, your journal entries
but have not updated it in a month, you can revisit the metanote,
invoke <code>denote-link-add-missing-links</code>, and then type the search
terms (e.g. <code>_journal</code>) to include what remains.

The <code>denote-link-find-backlink</code> provides a minibuffer interface that
shows all backlinks to the current note.  It complements the
existing <code>denote-link-backlinks</code> command (which also has the alias
<code>denote-link-show-backlinks-buffer</code>).  Each command has its own
niche: the minibuffer lets the user leverage powerful pattern
matching styles, such as those provided by the <code>orderless</code> package,
while the bespoke buffer provides an easy overview of what links to
the current note.

</p></li>

<li><p>
The <code>denote-keywords-add</code> and <code>denote-keywords-remove</code> are two
commands that interactively operate on the current note&rsquo;s front
matter to add or remove keywords.  They use the familiar keywords&rsquo;
prompt which means, among others, that they can read more than one
keyword at a time.  To specify multiple keywords, separate each
input with a comma (or whatever the value of <code>crm-separator</code> is,
which should be a comma unless something out-of-the-ordinary is in
force).

The <code>denote-link</code> command will now recognise an active region and
use its text as the description of the inserted link.  The default
behaviour is to use the file&rsquo;s title from its front matter or file
name.  Thanks to Charanjit Singh for the original contribution,

<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/109">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/109</a>.  A subsequent

The renaming operations are now aware of the underlying version
control system and will use the appropriate command when a VCS is
available.  In practice, renaming a file under, say, Git will
register it as a &ldquo;rename&rdquo; instead of two separate actions of
deletion and addition.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Florian for the patch.  It was discussed on the mailing
list and then underwent some changes:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C166547153518.8.941129310186454444.68125516@aboulafia.org%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C166547153518.8.941129310186454444.68125516@aboulafia.org%3E</a>.
</p></li>

<li>The <code>denote-rename-file-using-front-matter</code> no longer fails to carry
out its intended task when the front matter has no keywords.  If no
keywords are available, this is interpreted as a request to remove
the KEYWORDS component of the file name.  This was always
technically possible and could be achieved with various permutations
of the user option <code>denote-prompts</code> (as explained in its doc string
or the manual).  Denote only needs an identifier in the file name to
establish unique links (although I strongly encourage you to stick
to the standard file-naming scheme as it is informative, reliable,
and can work even if you access your data without Emacs).</li>

<li>The <code>:front-matter</code> property of the <code>denote-file-types</code> now accepts
a nil value.  Denote could always work without front matter, but
this was not implemented flexibly in the <code>denote-file-types</code>.
Thanks to Noboru Ota (nobiot) for pointing this out on the mailing

<li>The <code>denote-file-prompt</code> function now reads an optional
<code>INITIAL-TEXT</code> argument.  This is a string that prepopulates the
minibuffer.  It is useful for custom commands the user may have
where, for example, there is a need to automatically filter to
entries matching <code>_journal</code>.  Thanks to Alan Schmitt for suggesting
the idea: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87pmf676n1.fsf@m4x.org%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87pmf676n1.fsf@m4x.org%3E</a>.</li>

<li>The <code>denote-rename-file-using-front-matter</code> accepts an optional
<code>AUTO-CONFIRM</code> argument.  It can either be passed interactively or
via Lisp.  The doc string (or the manual) explains the details.
Thanks to Elias Storms for the initial patch:

<li>The <code>denote-prompt-for-date-return-id</code> function uses the familiar
<code>denote-date-prompt</code> and returns the appropriate identifier.  It is
used internally by some of our function, but we also provide it for
anyone who wants to write their own custom code.</li>

<li>The <code>denote-retrieve-or-create-file-identifier</code> function reads and
option <code>DATE</code> argument to its mandatory <code>FILE</code> argument.  If <code>FILE</code>
does not have an identifier and optional <code>DATE</code> is non-nil, the
function invokes the <code>denote-prompt-for-date-return-id</code>, as
mentioned above.</li>

<li><p>
The <code>denote-rename-file</code> command accepts an optional <code>DATE</code>
argument.  It functionally does what is described right above, with
the exception that this is for an interactive function (a
&ldquo;command&rdquo;).  Read the detailed doc string or the manual for
everything that pertains to this powerful command.

<li>Removed some minor duplication of effort in how the buttonisation of
links is done (what makes them clickable).</li>

<li>Made refinements to the definition of functions such as
<code>denote-link-add-links</code>.  There should be no noticeable change for
users, though this shows we care about code quality.</li>

<li>With Eshel Yaron, we tried to remove the empty indices for functions
and variables from the HTML version of the manual.  These indices
are useful in the Info version, which can be accessed directly from
Emacs when the <code>denote</code> package is installed (for example, evaluate
<code>(info "(denote) Top")</code>), but they do not work with HTML.  Alas,
what we tried to do did not work.  Maybe Org has a way to control
what is exported where.  We shall see.  At any rate, thanks to Eshel
for the effort: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/36028">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/36028</a>.</li>

<li>All code that integrates the <code>denote:</code> custom hyperlink type with
Org&rsquo;s link facility is now assigned <code>autoload</code> cookies.  These are
done to ensure that <code>denote</code> is loaded and is available in cases
where Org needs to access a <code>denote:</code> link at some early stage
(e.g. at startup before using Denote).  Thanks to Sven Seebeck for
reporting the problem: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87r0zovwix.fsf%40svenseebeck.me%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87r0zovwix.fsf%40svenseebeck.me%3E</a>.
Although Sven could not reproduce a bug reliably, I believe this
prevents such an eventuality.</li>

<li>Expanded or otherwise updated the manual to account for all of the
above, where appropriate.</li>

The custom Org hyperlink type of <code>denote:</code> can be visited from
outside the <code>denote-directory</code>.  We now provide the necessary glue
code that Org needs to store these <code>denote:</code> links.  Storing them
can be done with an <code>org-capture</code> template or via the command
<code>org-store-link</code>.  Use this to, for example, capture a TODO that
references one of your notes.
</p>

<p>
<code>denote:</code> links work for as long as the referenced file is somewhere
in the <code>denote-directory</code> or one of its subdirectories.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Marc Fargas for the contribution.  Marc did not need to
assign copyright to the Free Software Foundation, as the patch was
within the ~15 line limit that is permissible.
</p>

<p>
The contribution was discussed on the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/35137">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/35137</a>.  A prior
exchange took place in issue 104 over at the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/104">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/104</a>.
</p>

<p>
Some further tweaks were made to the relevant function.  Thanks to
Elias Storms for reporting on the mailing list a bug which revealed
a regression I introduced to the Org link storing mechanism:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C15D55F4B-64D1-4083-AD5E-B5BACA8F1909%40ap.be%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C15D55F4B-64D1-4083-AD5E-B5BACA8F1909%40ap.be%3E</a>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Following from above, the command <code>denote-link-find-file</code> finds
files reliably, regardless of where the link is stored.  All it
needs is for the target file to be inside the <code>denote-directory</code>.
</p>

<p>
I discovered this while exchanging views with Marc Fargas regarding
the aforementioned patch: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/35137">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/35137</a>.
</p></li>

<li>The command <code>denote-link-buttonize-buffer</code>, which &ldquo;buttonizes&rdquo;
<code>denote:</code> links in plain text and Markdown files, now performs its
task regardless of where the current file is stored.  Those links
work for as long as the file they reference is somewhere inside the
<code>denote-directory</code>.</li>

<li><p>
The commands <code>denote-link-after-creating</code>, <code>denote-link-or-create</code>
provide a convenience for users who need to create link to notes
that may not exist yet.  The idea is that one is expounding on a
given topic and wants to create a link to a relevant issue.  They
are not sure if they have written anything about it yet, so they
invoke the relevant command.  Consult their doc strings or read the
manual: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:9e41e7df-2aac-4835-94c5-659b6111e6de">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:9e41e7df-2aac-4835-94c5-659b6111e6de</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to user sienic for suggesting the idea and for testing the
prototypes.  And thanks to Juanjo Presa for participating in the
discussion to share the view that this functionality should be part of
denote.el.  This happened in issue 96 over at the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/96">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/96</a>.
</p></li>

<li>The command <code>denote-open-or-create</code> offers the convenience of
visiting a file, if it exists, else prompting for its creation.
Thanks to Alan Schmitt for the contribution.  The patch was sent on
the mailing list: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87fsgvddny.fsf%40protesilaos.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87fsgvddny.fsf%40protesilaos.com%3E</a>.
It is within the limit of what is allowed without assigning
copyright to the Free Software Foundation, though Alan has done the
relevant paperwork.</li>

<li>The manual expands on two sections: (1) Variants of
<code>denote-open-or-create</code>, (2) Variants of <code>denote-link-or-create</code>.
They show how one can use the above &ldquo;do or create&rdquo; commands with
different permutations of the Denote prompts for new note creation.</li>

<li><p>
The manual includes a section titled &ldquo;Create a note with the
region&rsquo;s contents&rdquo;.  Quote:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Sometimes it makes sense to gather notes in a single file and later
review it to make multiple notes out of it.  With the following
code, the user marks a region and then invokes the command
<code>my-denote-create-new-note-from-region</code>: it prompts for a title and
keywords and then uses the region&rsquo;s contents to fill in the newly
created note.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is not part of denote.el, though we provide it in the manual
for users that may need it.  Thanks to sundar bp for suggesting the
idea.  This was done via a private channel and the information is
shared with permission.
</p></li>

<li><p>
The manual has another entry titled &ldquo;Split an Org subtree into its
own note&rdquo;, which is similar to the above idea of using the region&rsquo;s
contents but has some extra niceties provided by Org.  Quote:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
With Org files in particular, it is common to have nested headings which
could be split off into their own standalone notes.  In Org parlance an
entry with all its subheadings is a &ldquo;subtree&rdquo;.  With the following code,
the user places the point inside the heading they want to split off and
invokes the command <code>my-denote-split-org-subtree</code>.  It will create a
note using the heading&rsquo;s text and tags for the new file.  The contents
of the subtree become the contents of the new note and are removed from
the old one.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thanks to Sven Seebeck for suggesting the idea and for testing my
prototypes.  This information is shared with permission, as it was
provided via a private channel.
</p></li>

<li>The manual describes how a user can leverage the built-in
<code>dired-virtual-mode</code> to perform arbitrary sorting of their list of
notes.  It also includes code for Eshell to quickly &ldquo;export&rdquo; a
command&rsquo;s output into a dedicated buffer (which can then be used to
derive a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; Dired).  Thanks to Yi Liu for asking the question
that inspired this entry:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C1C75FF01-EC76-49DF-9AEB-ED718A2795FF@gmail.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C1C75FF01-EC76-49DF-9AEB-ED718A2795FF@gmail.com%3E</a>.</li>

<li>The <code>denote-faces-broken-link</code> has been removed.  It was used for
Org links.  The idea was to apply a different style if the link was
broken.  However, the way fontification works means that there may
be a performance penalty as Org tries to check again and again if
the link is broken or note.  As <code>denote:</code> links are robust (unless
the user tries to break them), this penalty is unacceptable.  Thanks
to Peter Prevos for reporting the issue and discussing it with me on
the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87k05umyyo.fsf%40prevos.net%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87k05umyyo.fsf%40prevos.net%3E</a>.</li>

<li>The &ldquo;denote&rdquo; group in Custom UI buffers now provides a link to the
Info manual that is shipped with the package.  To read the manual,
evaluate <code>(info "(denote) Top")</code>.  Else visit the official web page:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote</a>.</li>

<li>Fixed a case where an internal check for a note would throw an error
if the buffer was not visiting a file.  Thanks to Hilde Rhyne was
the patch: it is below the ~15 line threshold and thus does not
require copyright assignment to the Free Software Foundation.  The
issue was discussed on the mailing list and was pushed to users as
version <code>0.6.1</code>:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3Cm035d7nq22.fsf%40disroot.org%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3Cm035d7nq22.fsf%40disroot.org%3E</a>.</li>

<li>When linking to a file that has no front matter, Denote tries to use
the TITLE component of the file name (per our file-naming scheme) as
the link&rsquo;s descriptive text.  We now make this look a bit better, by
capitalising only the first letter while dehyphenating the text,
converting <code>this-is-a-test</code> to <code>This is a test</code>.  Before, we would
capitalise all words.  Thanks to Clemens Radermacher for the patch.
It was sent via a private channel.  Clemens has assigned copyright
to the Free Software Foundation.</li>

Lots of functions and variables which once were for &ldquo;private&rdquo; use (the
presence of double hyphens in the symbol) are now made public.
Concretely this means that they no longer have double hyphens in their
name and we pledge to support them henceforth.  &ldquo;Support&rdquo; means that
we (i) consider them stable, (ii) document them properly, (iii) will
record any changes made to them such as in a change log, a blog post
on my website, and via <code>make-obsolete</code>.

Normally, we do not support private forms and can delete/modify them
without notice.  However, I decided to write obsoletion aliases for
all forms I made public or otherwise revised, in an effort not to
break any existing custom code.  The following table covers all
obsolete symbols and their new counterparts.  PLEASE UPDATE YOUR CODE
as those aliases will be removed in the near future.

<li>The Denote linking facility can now link to any file that has the
Denote file-naming scheme.  Before, we limited this feature to what we
consider &ldquo;note&rdquo; files, else the supported plain text formats (per
<code>denote-file-type</code>).  Thanks to Peter Prevos for the discussion on the
mailing list: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87fsi1m5ze.fsf%40prevos.net%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87fsi1m5ze.fsf%40prevos.net%3E</a>.</li>

<li>Date prompts may optionally use the familiar Org date-selection
mechanism that leverages the calendar.  This feature is subject to the
user option <code>denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date</code>.  A date prompt is
used by the <code>denote-date</code> command or, optionally, by the <code>denote</code>
command when the user option <code>denote-prompts</code> is configured
accordingly.  The manual elaborates on the specificities.  Thanks to

Leading empty spaces at the <code>denote</code> <code>TITLE</code> prompt no longer produce
hyphens: they are simply ignored to keep file names consistent.

<li>When linking to files that have no front matter, the link&rsquo;s anchor
text (the human-readable part) is derived from the file name <code>TITLE</code>
component.  We apply a de-hyphenation and capitalisation of its
constituent words.  This is not always perfect, but it is better than
something like <code>this-is-the-title</code>.  Thanks to Peter Prevos for the
original idea in pull request 93 at the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/93">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/93</a>.</li>

<li><p>
The active region is now used as the default value of the <code>denote</code>
command <code>TITLE</code> prompt.  The idea behind this Do-What-I-Mean-flavoured
patch is to be able to take a note about a subject that appears in a
buffer by simply marking it before invoking the <code>denote</code> command.

It is below the ~15 line threshold that thus requires no copyright

<li>The <code>denote-rename-file-using-front-matter</code> command now offers to save
the buffer if appropriate.  In the past, it would simply produce an
error asking the user to save the buffer.  Thanks to Peter Prevos for

The variable <code>denote-file-types</code> is an alist of plists which
substantiates the supported file types (per the user option
<code>denote-file-type</code>).  Properties pertain to the formatting of front
matter and the retrieval of relevant values.  The doc string of
<code>denote-file-types</code> explains the details, while the default value uses
the ancillary functions we define.  Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay

<p>
The general theme of this release is to refine what we already offer.
As I explained in some discussions, Denote is feature-complete.  We can
always improve the code or add some ancillary function/command/variable,
though all the main ideas have already been implemented.  Additional
functionality can be provided by other packages: I remain at the
disposal of anyone willing to write such a package.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:0878125f-8392-48e6-aeff-1469eb1e18fc">
<p>
We now provide the <code>denote-templates</code> user option.  A &ldquo;template&rdquo; is
arbitrary text that Denote will add to a newly created note right below
the front matter.
</p>

<p>
Templates are expressed as a <code>(KEY . STRING)</code> association.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <code>KEY</code> is the name which identifies the template.  It is an
arbitrary symbol, such as <code>report</code>, <code>memo</code>, <code>statement</code>.</li>

<li>The <code>STRING</code> is ordinary text that Denote will insert as-is.  It can
contain newline characters to add spacing.  The manual of Denote
contains examples on how to use the <code>concat</code> function, beside writing
a generic string:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:f635a490-d29e-4608-9372-7bd13b34d56c">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:f635a490-d29e-4608-9372-7bd13b34d56c</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The user can choose a template either by invoking the new command
<code>denote-template</code> or by changing the user option <code>denote-prompts</code> to
always prompt for a template when calling the <code>denote</code> command.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:17688b79-cb1b-4a59-831e-fbf2a81245d3">
<p>
Denote used to format tags in Org files by separating them with two
spaces:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org60c9003">
#+filetags:  tag1  tag2
</pre>

<p>
While this worked for some obvious use-cases, it is not supported by
Org.  The Org documentation stipulates that tags be separated by the
colon sign.  The above would then be written thus:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org217201b">
#+filetags:  :tag1:tag2:
</pre>

<p>
Denote now conforms with Org&rsquo;s specifications.  To help users update
their existing notes, we provide the <code>denote-migrate-old-org-filetags</code>
command.  It will perform the conversion in all Org files that had the
old notation.  As with all Denote operations that rewrite file contents,
it DOES NOT SAVE BUFFERS.  The user is expected to review the changes,
such as by using <code>diff-buffer-with-file</code>.  Multiple buffers can be saved
with <code>save-some-buffers</code> (check its doc string).
</p>

<p>
This command is provided for the convenience of the user.  It shall be
deprecated and eventually removed from future versions of Denote.
</p>

<p>
If you need help with any of this, please do not hesitate to contact me
either in private or in one of Denote&rsquo;s official channels (mailing list,
GitHub/GitLab mirror).

<p>
This is the same idea as above.  Before, we were making the mistake of
using incorrect YAML notation:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-yaml">tags:  tag1  tag2
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now we do:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-yaml">tags:  ["tag1", "tag2"]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is how the TOML variant always worked.
</p>

<p>
For the user&rsquo;s convenience, we provide a command to migrate from the old
to the new syntax: <code>denote-migrate-old-markdown-yaml-tags</code>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:15ecb4e8-d1ce-4e42-b74d-a3a046d93220">
<p>
Denote adds &ldquo;front matter&rdquo; to newly created notes which includes data
such as the title and keywords/tags of the document.  Strictly speaking,
the front matter is not required by Denote.  It is provided for the
user&rsquo;s convenience, such as for readability or if they want to use the
note with other programs (e.g. Org export, a blog with Hugo/Jekyll,
&#x2026;).
</p>

<p>
Denote provides commands which help the user rename their notes, by
changing the file name&rsquo;s <code>TITLE</code> and/or <code>KEYWORDS</code> components (per
Denote&rsquo;s file-naming scheme).  These commands also operate on the front
matter to keep the data between file name and file contents in sync
(again, for the user&rsquo;s convenience).
</p>

<p>
For this release we have consolidated and refined our offerings in order
to improve their ergonomics.  All changes are the result of fruitful
discussions on the mailing list and the issue tracker of the GitHub
mirror:

<p>
The commands <code>denote-dired-rename-file-and-add-front-matter</code> and
<code>denote-dired-rename-file</code> are deprecated and superseded by the new
<code>denote-rename-file</code>.  Please update any key bindings in your setup.
</p>

<p>
The difference between the old commands and the new <code>denote-rename-file</code>
is that the latter will now insert front matter to supported file types
(per <code>denote-file-type</code>) if they have none.  This basically means that,
e.g., renaming a generic Org/Markdown/Plain text file with
<code>denote-rename-file</code> will update its file name to comply with Denote&rsquo;s
file-naming scheme and also add the appropriate front matter (it
&ldquo;converts&rdquo; it to a Denote note).  If front matter exists, this command
will rewrite it to reflect the changes to the file name&rsquo;s <code>TITLE</code> and/or
<code>KEYWORDS</code>.
</p>

<p>
Consult the manual for the details:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:7cc9e000-806a-48da-945c-711bbc7426b0">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:7cc9e000-806a-48da-945c-711bbc7426b0</a>.

</div>

<p>
The user option <code>denote-dired-rename-expert</code> is obsolete.  Denote always
asks for confirmation when renaming a single file.  This is because the
user can rely on batch-renaming commands which ask for confirmation only
once per batch.

<p>
The command <code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files-and-add-front-matter</code> is
deprecated and its functionality is absorbed by the existing
<code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files</code> command.  The deprecated command was
used to insert front matter to supported file types (per
<code>denote-file-type</code>) that had none.  We now handle this internally, thus
streamlining the experience for the user.

Introduced the <code>denote-rename-file-using-front-matter</code> command.  This is
new functionality we provide which uses the front matter as input to
perform a rename of the file.  The aforementioned offerings prompt for
input via the minibuffer and propagate the changes firstly to the file
name and subsequently to the front matter.  Whereas with the command
<code>denote-rename-file-using-front-matter</code>, the user can edit the front
matter manually and then invoke the command to pass the changes to the
file name, subject to a confirmation.  Relevant entries are the title
and tags/filetags (depending on the file type).  The date and the
identifier are not pertinent.  Identifiers in file names are NEVER
rewritten by Denote.

<p>
The default value of the <code>denote-directory</code> user option used to be

conforms with the freedesktop.org specifications by using the <code>XDG</code>
directory for <code>DOCUMENTS</code> instead of <code>~/Documents</code>:
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs/">https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs/</a>.

<p>
Users who already bind the <code>denote-directory</code> are not affected by this

All Denote code is consolidated in <code>denote.el</code>.  We no longer maintain

Furthermore, user options and faces now specify the version of Denote
that last affected their value (e.g. <code>denote-directory</code>, which was
mentioned above for the XDG spec, now informs the user that it changed
for version <code>0.5.0</code>).

are now deemed surplus to requirements.</li>

strings, and comments, in the interest of simplifying the code and/or
ensuring consistency in how operations are carried out.  Though
everything is the same for the end-user.</li>

Emacs already has all the requisite functionality, though encryption per

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-h:068108f4-a4fa-4ff8-be49-f1f10a862451">
<p>
There was a discussion started by Fourchaux, with the participation of
basaran and Andre0991 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/71">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/71</a>.
</p>

<p>
The gist of my answer is that Denote does not need to provide such a
facility because notes are ordinary files: whatever the user already has
for them should apply to Denote.  If the user has nothing to search
through files, they anyhow need something that works outside the
confines of Denote: a <code>denote-SEARCH</code> command is not an adequate
solution.
</p>

<p>
Emacs has numerous built-in commands, such as <code>grep</code> (<code>lgrep</code> and
<code>rgrep</code>), <code>project-find-regexp</code>, <code>find-grep-dired</code>, <code>ibuffer-do-occur</code>,
&#x2026;  Furthermore, there are lots of high quality packages that have
their own wrappers or extensions for searching file contents, such as
the <code>ivy</code> and <code>helm</code> completion frameworks, as well as <code>consult</code> (the
commands <code>consult-grep</code> and <code>consult-ripgrep</code>), <code>consult-notes</code>, <code>rg</code>,
<code>deadgrep</code>, <code>deft</code>, and probably plenty more that do not come to mind
right now.
</p>

<p>
I strongly encourage the user to find a universal search solution to the
problem of searching file contents.

Defined the <code>denote-link-dired-marked-notes</code> command.  It lets the
user produce a typographic list of links to the note files that are
marked in Dired.  The list is written at point.  If there are multiple
buffers which visit Denote notes, the command first prompts with
minibuffer completion for one among them.
</p>

<p>
In terms of workflow, <code>denote-link-dired-marked-notes</code> complements the
<code>denote-link-add-links</code> command for those cases where it is easier to
select files than write an elegant regular expression.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Implemented the <code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files</code> command.  This
provides a much-requested facility to perform the familiar renaming
operation on a set of files.  In particular:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the file&rsquo;s existing file name is retained and becomes the <code>TITLE</code>
field, per Denote&rsquo;s file-naming scheme;</li>

<li>the <code>TITLE</code> is sluggified and downcased, per our conventions;</li>

<li>an identifier is prepended to the <code>TITLE</code>;</li>

<li>the file&rsquo;s extension is retained;</li>

<li>a prompt is asked once for the <code>KEYWORDS</code> field and the input is
applied to all file names;</li>

<li>if the file is recognised as a Denote note, the command rewrites its
front matter to include the new keywords.  A confirmation to carry
out this step is performed once at the outset.  Note that the
affected buffers are not saved.  The user can thus check them to
confirm that the new front matter does not cause any problems
(e.g. with the command <code>diff-buffer-with-file</code>).  Multiple buffers
can be saved with <code>save-some-buffers</code> (read its doc string).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Parts of <code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files</code> were added or refined over
a series of commits.  Consult the Git log for the minutia.  Thanks to
Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the relevant additions in pull requests
51 and 52 on the GitHub mirror:

<li>Improved how the <code>denote-dired-rename-file</code> command rewrites front
matter.  Before, it would perform a replacement of the whole block,
which had the adverse effect of overwriting custom front matter
entries.  Now, it only targets the lines which hold the title and
keywords, leaving everything else intact.  Thanks to Peter Prevos for
reporting the problem and testing the solution to it in issue 60 on
the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/60">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/60</a>.</li>

<li><p>
Introduced the <code>denote-dired-rename-file-and-add-front-matter</code> command
that always prepends front matter to a file whose extension is among
the supported ones (per the user option <code>denote-file-type</code>).  This
differs from the standard <code>denote-dired-rename-file</code> command which
only rewrites the front matter&rsquo;s title and keywords if they exist.
</p>

<p>
In practice, <code>denote-dired-rename-file-and-add-front-matter</code> empowers
the user to convert a generic text file to a Denote note.
</p>

<p>
This command was originally added by Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay in pull
request 49 on the GitHub mirror and refined in subsequent commits:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/49">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/49</a>.  Also read issue 48

</p></li>

<li>Added the <code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files-and-add-front-matters</code>
command, which is like the <code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files</code> but adds
front matter instead of rewriting existing one, just how the command
<code>denote-dired-rename-file-and-add-front-matter</code> does it (both are
mentioned above).  Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the
refinements to it in pull request 53 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/53">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/53</a>.</li>

<li>Wrote an interactive spec for <code>denote-link-buttonize-buffer</code>.  It can
now be invoked with <code>M-x</code> or a key binding, should the need arise.

text as well as Markdown files.</li>

where it would not recognise links without a title in their format
(those can be inserted by passing a prefix argument (<code>C-u</code> by default)
to the commands that insert links, such as <code>denote-link</code>).</li>

<li>Attached conditionality to the <code>denote</code> command&rsquo;s <code>SUBDIRECTORY</code>
argument, so that it does not create new file paths.  This is only
relevant for those who call <code>denote</code> from Lisp.  Interactive use is
the same as before.</li>

<li>Clarified that the user option <code>denote-org-capture-specifiers</code> can
accept arbitrary text in addition to the formatting specifiers that
Org&rsquo;s capture mechanism introduces.</li>

<li>Explained in the manual why <code>denote-org-capture-specifiers</code> is needed
instead of writing the capture template directly the way one normally
does.  The gist is that because our file names are derived dynamically
based on user input, we need to account for the sequence in which the
value of arguments is reified by <code>org-capture</code>.</li>

<li>Refactored how notes are prepared internally.  Thanks to Jean-Philippe
Gagné Guay for the contribution in pull request 55 on the GitHub
mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/55">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/55</a>.</li>

<li><p>
Declared the <code>denote-punctuation-excluded-extra-regexp</code> variable which
is, for the time being, targeted at experienced users.  Its purpose is
to extend what we consider &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; punctuation for the file name.
Thanks to pRot0ta1p for the feedback in issue 57 over at the GitHub
mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/57">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/57</a>.  Example
based on the input of pRot0ta1p:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (setq denote-punctuation-excluded-extra-regexp
        "[『』〖〗｛｝「」【】〔〕［］（）《》〈〉«»！＃￥％…＆＂＇＊，。；：、？—]*")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The ideal is to make <code>denote--punctuation-regexp</code> work for all
scripts, but that may be unrealistic.
</p></li>

<li>Clarified what the manual means by &ldquo;attachments&rdquo; to notes.  Those are
for Org, if the user resorts to the relevant Org mechanisms.  Denote
does not do any of that.</li>

<li><p>
Revised the parsing of a date input as used in the <code>denote-date</code>
command or related.  The idea is to turn <code>2020-01-15</code> into something
like <code>2020-01-15 16:19</code> by using the current time, so that the hour
and minute component is not left to <code>00:00</code> when the user does not
specify it explicitly.
</p>

<p>
This reduces the burden on the user who would otherwise need to input
the time value in order to avoid the error of duplicate identifiers in
the scenario where the same date is used more than once.
</p>

<p>
The change also addresses a difference between Emacs 28 and Emacs 29
where the former does not read dates without a time component.
</p>

mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/58">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/58</a>.
</p></li>

<li>Fixed compilation warnings in Emacs 29 about the format of doc strings
that need to output a literal single quote.  Thanks to Kyle Meyer for
the patch, which was sent on the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/34117">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/34117</a>.</li>

<li>Fixed typo in the user option <code>denote-prompts</code> about the
<code>crm-separator</code>.  Thanks to Kyle Meyer for the patch, which was sent
on the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/34116">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/34116</a>.</li>

<li>Made the built-in <code>subr-x</code> library a runtime dependency, due to
complications with the <code>when-let*</code> form.  The problem was made
manifest in a renaming operation, though it was not about renaming per
se.  Thanks to hpgisler for reporting the problem in issue 62 and for
testing the proposed solution:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/62">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/62</a>.</li>

<li>Streamlined the use of the <code>seq</code> library instead of <code>cl-lib</code>, as we
were already using the former more heavily and there was no need for
the latter.  Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for pointing this out on the
emacs-devel mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-07/msg00838.html">https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-07/msg00838.html</a>.</li>

<li>Added a generic <code>README.md</code> file to placate the Git forges.  Neither
SourceHut nor GitHub/GitLab are fully compliant with the Org markup we
use in <code>README.org</code> (we use Org because it is easy to generate the
Info manual and HTML pages out of it).  SourceHut will not render the
file at all, while the others render it but do not parse it properly.</li>

<li>Made several other internal tweaks and refinements in the interest of
robustness and/or clarity.</li>

<li>Rewrote all relevant documentation.</li>

The following are not part of any changes that were made during this
release cycle, though they provide potentially interesting insight into
the workings of the project.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Identifiers with milliseconds</dt><dd>Denote&rsquo;s identifier format extends up
to seconds.  This is the product of years of experimentation and is,
in my opinion, the best compromise between usability/readability and
precision.  If a user produces two notes within a fraction of a
second, then yes they will have duplicate identifiers.  In principle,
there is no reason not to address this potential problem, provided we
do not compromise on Denote&rsquo;s file-naming scheme (making the
identifier less readable is a compromise).  We shall see what the best
course of action is.  Thanks to Felipe Balbi and Jean-Philippe Gagné
Guay for the discussion thus far in issue 54 on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/54">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/54</a>.</dd>

<dt>Denote and evil-mode</dt><dd>Users of evil-mode do not have to worry about
Denote, as we do not define any key bindings.  The manual includes
sample configuration, which proposes some key bindings, but that is
the user&rsquo;s prerogative.  Thanks to Saša Janiška and Alan Schmitt for
their participation on the mailing list:

<dt>Denote and Citar</dt><dd>Peter Prevos started developing a package that
connects Denote with Citar: <a href="https://github.com/pprevos/denote-citar">https://github.com/pprevos/denote-citar</a>.
The idea is to use notes as part of one&rsquo;s bibliography.  Discussions
which include sample code on how to leverage <code>denote</code> from Lisp:

<ul class="org-ul">

</ul></dd>

<dt>Denote and graph of connections</dt><dd>Saša Janiška asked whether Denote
will provide some way to visualise links between notes.  The answer is
negative.  Denote&rsquo;s scope is clearly delineated and its feature set is
largely complete (notwithstanding refinements to what we already
provide).  Peter Prevos is experimenting with some code that uses the
R language.  Any such facility will have to be implemented as a
separate package.  I remain at the disposal of anyone who needs help
with Denote&rsquo;s internals.  Thanks to the aforementioned fellows for
their participation on the mailing list:

<dt>Denote&rsquo;s scalability</dt><dd>There was a discussion whether Denote will
work well with very large sets of files.  The short answer is that it
will work the same way Emacs and/or standard Unix tools do: good
enough!  If there are improvements to be made, which do not jeopardise
the principles of the project, we shall implement them without
hesitation.  Thanks to Saša Janiška and Peter Prevos for their
participation on the mailing list:

<dt>Denote&rsquo;s minimum requirement of Emacs 27.2</dt><dd><p>
We cannot depend on
Emacs 27.1 due to this message from the byte compiler:
</p>

<pre class="example">
You should depend on (emacs "27.2") or the (org "9.3") package if you need `org-link-open-as-file'.
</pre>


<p>
Depending on Org is not an option because Denote optionally works
without Org, so Emacs 27.2 is what we have to opt for.  If your
operating system does not provide this version in package format,
please petition its maintainers/providers to do so.  Thanks to
Alexander for asking about it on the mailing list:

<p>
Finally, a mildly interesting piece of trivia: we have exceeded 600
commits since the first day of the project&rsquo;s Git history on 2022-06-04
(the actual history is much longer).  That averages to more than 10 per
day!  I think things will slow down eventually.

Fixed how references are analysed to produce the backlinks&rsquo; buffer.
This should resolve the issue that some users faced where the
backlinks would not be produced.
</p>

<p>
The previous implementation would not yield the appropriate results if
(i) the value of the user option <code>denote-directory</code> was a &ldquo;project&rdquo;
per the built-in project.el and (ii) the link to the given entry was
from a subdirectory.  In short, the references were sometimes returned
as relative file paths, whereas they should always be absolute.

<li><p>
Addressed a regression in the function <code>denote-directory</code> (this is the
function that normalises the variable of the same name) which
prevented it from returning an expanded file path.  This too
contributed to problems with the backlinking facility.  Thanks to
Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the contribution in pull request 44 over

More thanks to Alfredo Borrás, Benjamin Kästner, and Sven Seebeck for
their comments in a related thread on the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3CCA73E705-1194-4324-9962-70708C4C72E5%40zoho.eu%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3CCA73E705-1194-4324-9962-70708C4C72E5%40zoho.eu%3E</a>.
These discussions showed we had a problem, which we managed to
identify.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Introduced the user option <code>denote-prompts</code> (read its doc string or
the relevant entry in the manual).  It governs how the standard
<code>denote</code> command for creating new notes will behave in interactive
usage.  By default, <code>denote</code> prompts for a title and keywords.  With
<code>denote-prompts</code>, the command can also ask for a file type (per
<code>denote-file-type</code>), subdirectory of the <code>denote-directory</code>, and a
specific date+time.  Prompts occur in the order they are specified.
Furthermore, the <code>denote-prompts</code> can be set to values which do not
include the title and keywords.  This means that the resulting file
names can be any of those permutations:
</p>

<pre class="example">
DATE.EXT
DATE--TITLE.EXT
DATE__KEYWORDS.EXT
</pre>


<p>
Recall that Denote&rsquo;s standard file-naming scheme is defined as follows
(read the manual for the details):
</p>

<pre class="example">
DATE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXT
</pre>


<p>
For our purposes, Denote will work perfectly fine for linking and
backlinking, even if file names do not include the <code>TITLE</code> and
<code>KEYWORDS</code> fields.  However, the user is advised to consider the
implications on usability: notes without a descriptive title and/or
useful keywords may be hard to filter and practically impossible to
manage at scale.  File names without such information should at least
be added to subdirectories which themselves have a descriptive name.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, Denote does not have strong opinions about one&rsquo;s
workflow.  The standard file name is the culmination of years of
experience.
</p>

<p>
Consider the <code>denote-prompts</code> the affirmative answer to the question
&ldquo;Can keywords be optional?&rdquo; as posed by Jack Baty on the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C8D392BC3-980A-4E5B-9480-D6A00BE8279F%40baty.net%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C8D392BC3-980A-4E5B-9480-D6A00BE8279F%40baty.net%3E</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the original contribution in
commit 9b981a2.  It was originally part of a pull request, but due to
some internal changes I had to merge it as a patch and technically the
web UI did not count the PR as &ldquo;merged&rdquo; (though it was in terms of
substance).
</p></li>

<li><p>
Refactored the <code>denote</code> command to (i) accommodate the new user option
<code>denote-prompts</code> via its interactive specification and (ii) be more
flexible when called from Lisp.  The latter scenario is for advanced
users or, generally, those who can maintain some custom code in their
configuration.  A case in point is one of the examples we show in the
manual for a programmatic way to create notes that automatically get
the <code>journal</code> tag:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (defun my-denote-journal ()
    "Create an entry tagged 'journal', while prompting for a title."
    (interactive)
    (denote
     (denote--title-prompt)
     '("journal")))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Notice that the <code>'("journal")</code> is a list of strings even for a single
keyword.  Whereas before a single one was a plain string.  This is a
breaking change.
</p>

<p>
Please consult the doc string of the <code>denote</code> command for the
technicalities.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Refashioned the interactive convenience functions of <code>denote-type</code>,
<code>denote-date</code>, <code>denote-subdirectory</code> to leverage the <code>denote-prompts</code>
user option while calling <code>denote</code> interactively.  In practical terms,
they no longer accept any arguments when called from Lisp.  Users who
need a programmatic approach are advised to either call <code>denote</code>
directly, or check how these commands <code>let</code> bind the <code>denote-prompts</code>
to carry out their operations.  The doc string of each command
explains how it works.  Or evaluate this to check the manual:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (info "(denote) Convenience commands for note creation")
</pre>
</div>

</p></li>

<li><p>
Documented how the user option <code>denote-directory</code> can accept a local
value.  This is pertinent to scenaria where the user needs to maintain
separate directories of notes.  By &ldquo;separate&rdquo; we mean sets of notes
that do not communicate with each other, cannot create links between
them, etc.  The manual delves into the technicalities.  If you have
the Info entry installed, evaluate:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (info "(denote) Maintain separate directories for notes")

</p></li>

<li>Added an entry to the manual&rsquo;s Frequently Asked Questions about a
failed search for backlinks.  It includes sample code that users of
Windows can apply, if necessary.  (The error is not Denote&rsquo;s fault.)
Thanks to Benjamin Kästner for the patch, which is below the ~15 line
threshold and thus does not require copyright assignment to the Free
Software Foundation:

<li>Removed duplicate entries from the list of file paths that the <code>xref</code>
library returns for the purposes of backlinking.  Thanks to
Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the contribution in pull request 44 on
the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/44">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/44</a>.</li>

<li>Applied an appropriate face to the backlinks&rsquo; button to mitigate an
error.  Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the contribution in
pull request 45 on the GitHub mirror and for later testing a
subsequent tweak: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/45">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/45</a>.</li>

<li>Simplfied all the faces we define to make them work with all themes.
The previous colours were consistent with the <code>modus-themes</code>:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes</a>.</li>

<li>Refined how strings are sluggified under all circumstances.  Before, a
nil value for the user option <code>denote-allow-multi-word-keywords</code> would
have the adverse effect of joining all the strings in the title field
of the file name.  The intent always was to do that only for
multi-word keywords, not the title.  This change was part of a hotfix,
formalised as version <code>0.2.1</code> a day after the release of <code>0.2.0</code>.</li>

<li>Made the fontification rules more robust, while avoiding any false
positives.  This was done over a series of commits as it had
implications for the file name permutations that were mentioned
earlier.  Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the patches and/or
discussion about the merits of each change and concomitant
considerations:

user-facing aspects of the aforementioned.</li>

Discussed a use-case of rewriting old journal entries as Denote-style
files.  As of this writing, we do not support migration of files in
bulk.  It might happen at some point, though it is no mean task.

<li>Version <code>0.1.0</code> (from 2022-06-27) was never built as a package.  The
reason is that the GNU ELPA machinery reads the <code>Version:</code> header of
the main file, not the git tag.  As the original commit in <code>denote.el</code>
included <code>Version: 0.1.0</code>, GNU ELPA rightly tries to build the package
using that reference.  But because at that time I had not yet updated
the Copyright header to name the Free Software Foundation, the package
could not be prepared.  As such, please consider this release to be
the &ldquo;first formal stable version&rdquo;.  My apologies for the delay,

package on the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C9d600ff0-4fed-2ad7-5dbc-5a194639a045@gmail.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C9d600ff0-4fed-2ad7-5dbc-5a194639a045@gmail.com%3E</a>.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Originally, Denote was designed to only work with notes in a flat
directory.  With code contributions from Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay,
support for subdirectories of the user option <code>denote-directory</code> is
now available.  This covers the case of creating links between notes,
following them, and viewing the backlinks&rsquo; buffer of the current
entry.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Thanks to Jean-Philippe for the contributions which took place on
the GitHub mirror:

<li>The new <code>denote-subdirectory</code> command lets the user select a directory
to place the new note in.  Available candidates are the value of the
<code>denote-directory</code> as well as all of its subdirectories, minus <code>.git</code>.
In future versions, we will consider how to provide a blocklist or a
regexp filter for the user to specify which subdirectories should be
omitted from minibuffer completion.  Please consider providing your
feedback on the technicalities.

</ul></li>

<li>From 2022-06-24 to 2022-07-03, Denote provided support for links
between Org notes that leveraged the <code>id:</code> hyperlink type.
Discussions on the mailing list and the GitHub mirror revealed the
longer-term problems in our implementation.  In the Annex below, I
provide my detailed opinion on the matter.  The gist is that Denote
does not&#x2014;and will not&#x2014;create <code>id:</code> links between its notes, but
shall use the <code>denote:</code> hyperlink type instead (which works like the
standard <code>file:</code> type).  As the Annex explains, Denote is not org-roam
lite and we try not to engender such false expectations.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Despite the fact that the relevant patches are no longer applicable,
I wish to thank Kaushal Modi and Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for their
contributions over at the GitHub mirror:

</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>
The user option <code>denote-date-format</code> controls how the date and time is
recorded in the file&rsquo;s contents (what we call &ldquo;front matter&rdquo;).  When
nil (the default value), we use a file-type-specific format (also
check the user option <code>denote-file-type</code>):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For Org, an inactive timestamp is used, such as <code>[2022-06-30 Wed 15:31]</code>.</li>

<li>For Markdown, the RFC3339 standard is applied: <code>2022-06-30T15:48:00+03:00</code>.</li>

<li>For plain text, the format is that of ISO 8601: <code>2022-06-30</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the value is a string, ignore the above and use it instead.  The
string must include format specifiers for the date.  These are described
in the doc string of <code>format-time-string</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-date-format</code> supersedes the now obsolete
<code>denote-front-matter-date-format</code>.
</p>

Thanks to Peter Prevos and Kaushal Modi for their feedback in issue 27
on the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/27">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/27</a>.
</p></li>

<li>All the faces we define are now declared in the <code>denote-faces.el</code>
file.  The fontification rules are shared by <code>denote-dired-mode</code> and
the backlinks&rsquo; buffer (invoked by <code>denote-link-backlinks</code> and
controlled by the user option <code>denote-link-fontify-backlinks</code>).  The
current list of faces:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>denote-faces-date</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-delimiter</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-extension</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-keywords</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-subdirectory</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-time</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-title</code></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Named the mailing list address as the <code>Maintainer:</code> of Denote.
Together with the other package headers, they help the user find our
primary sources and/or communication channels.  This change conforms
with work being done upstream in package.el by Philip Kaludercic.  I
was informed about it here:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/%3C875ykl84yi.fsf%40posteo.net%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/%3C875ykl84yi.fsf%40posteo.net%3E</a>.</li>

<li>Fixed how keywords are inferred and combined.  The previous code did not
work properly when the user option <code>denote-infer-keywords</code> was nil.
It would return a list of symbols, with the parentheses, whereas the
file name needs a string where each keyword is delimited by an
underscore.</li>

<li>Simplified how information in the front matter is retrieved.  It fixes
cases where, for example, a special character at the end of the title
was ignored.  Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the patch over at
the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/21">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/21</a>.</li>

commit f35ef05cb451f265213c3aafc1e62c425b1ff043

    REMOVE support for 'id:' hyperlink types

    The original idea was to support the 'org-id' library on the premise
    that it makes Denote a good Emacs citizen.  However, discussions on the
    mailing list[0] and the GitHub mirror[1] have made it clear to me that
    'org-id' is not consistent with Denote's emphasis on simplicity.

    To support the way 'org-id' works, we will eventually have to develop
    some caching mechanism, just how the org-roam package does it.  This is
    because the variable 'org-id-extra-files' needs to be kept up-to-date
    whenever an operation on a file is performed.  At scale, this sort of
    monitoring requires specialised software.  Such a mechanism is outside
    the scope of Denote---if you need a db, use org-roam which is already
    great.

    [0] &lt;https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C8735fk4y1w.fsf%40hallac.net%3E#%3C877d4un73c.fsf@protesilaos.com%3E&gt;

    [1] &lt;https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/29&gt;

    Quote of what I wrote on the GitHub mirror issue 29:

            [ggjp] This is what I was implying.  That we are, in fact,
            providing an option that is not viable long-term, but keeping
            the option for expert users who will be able to handle this.
            And we should warn about this clearly in the doc of that option.

        [protesilaos] What you write here @ggjp and what @shrysr explained
        tells me that those expert users will need to be real experts.  To
        put it concretely, I am an experienced Emacs user with no
        programming background, who has written several Emacs
        packages (including the modus-themes which are built into Emacs),
        but I have zero knowledge of using a db or of handling things with
        python and the like.  So if I opt in to 'denote-link-use-org-id' I
        will eventually run into problems that my non-existent skills will
        prevent me from solving.  At that point, I will just use org-roam
        which already handles this use-case in a competent way (and has a
        massive community to rely on in case I need further support).

        If each package needs to write its own optimisations and maintain
        its own cache, to me this shows that 'org-id' is not good enough for
        the time being: more work needs to be done in org.git to provide a
        universal solution.

        I wanted to support 'org-id' by default on the premise that Denote
        must be a good Emacs citizen which interoperates with the rest of
        the wider ecosystem.  But if 'org-id' leaves something to be
        desired, then that goal is not worth pursuing: we add complexity to
        our code, offer an option that we cannot genuinely/adequately
        support, and make usage of it contingent on reading the docs and
        having a high level of expertise.

        I think being a good Emacs citizen is a laudable principle.  In this
        case, the right thing to do is to recommend the use of org-roam
        instead of trying to accommodate 'org-id'.  As such, I have now
        changed my mind and think we should remove what we previously added.

        For some context here: the reason I never used org-roam is
        because (i) it is Org-specific whereas I write notes in different
        file types and (ii) I did not want to ever rely on a db or
        equivalent dependency.

Followed up by my explanation:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">&gt; can we not have denote style links to be default for (de)notes - and
&gt; explicitly supported, while if they need to, users can still link
&gt; denote org files via org-id to any other notes/files (and vice versa)
&gt; -- in which case performance + testing for org-id driven linking is
&gt; not within Denote's purview at all?

The formal support for `id:` links was added shortly before the release
of version `0.1.0`.  In the days prior, we supported what you describe
via the manual.  The user could change the `denote-org-front-matter`
variable to include a `PROPERTIES` drawer.  This possibility still
exists, though yesterday I removed the relevant entry from the manual.
This way only the real do-it-yourself experts will go down that path.

My concern here is with managing expectations.  If our Org notes are
superficially the same as org-roam's, an unsuspecting user may think
that Denote is an org-roam lite.  We will thus get issues/requests, such
as those already mentioned in this GitHub repo, about migrating from
org-roam to Denote.  While there are similarities, Denote is not a
minimalist org-roam and I would not like to encourage the idea of
treating the two as interchangeable.

Doing things half-way-through is a way to create false expectations.  A
package on GNU ELPA must be usable by users of all skill levels.  If the
functionality we provide is incomplete and needs to be covered by
user-level tweaks, we are excluding a portion of the user base while
still assuming the maintenance burden.  If someone trusts Denote to,
say, write a 1000 notes, we do not want to surprise them after the fact.
Imagine if the reported issues that triggered this change happened 6
months into one's daily usage of Denote: it wouldn't be nice.

Setting the right expectations is a matter of responsibility: we let the
user make a more informed choice and show respect for their time.  It
also makes it easier for me to keep Denote's scope in check by not
supporting every little extra that Org implements.  The premier Org
extension is org-roam: we do not need another one (or, if we do, I am
not the one to implement it).

* * *

Some comments on the `denote:` hyperlink type for Org as they may be
relevant in this context:

* It is meant to work like the standard `file:` type.  This means that
  it links to a file, while it can also have additional search
  parameters, as explained in the Org manual.  Evaluate:

      (info "(org) Search Options")

* It does not read the front matter, but only the file name.  You can
  create a note as usual, delete all its contents, save it, and try to
  link to it from another note.  It works.

* Exporting now works like the `file:` type for HTML, LaTeX, Texinfo,
  and Markdown.  Technically, it also supports the ASCII backend but the
  format of the output could be tweaked further.

There may be refinements to be made, which is okay as that is part of a
maintainer's duties.

The front matter of notes in Org has changed to be compliant with the
standard <code>org-id</code> infrastructure.  A <code>PROPERTIES</code> drawer is added to
the top of the file, which includes an <code>ID</code> property with the value of
the Denote identifier.  Sample:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:          20220610T202537

The front matter of Markdown (YAML or TOML) and plain text files
remains constant.  For completeness, this is how they look:

<li>The integration with <code>org-id</code> extends to how linking works.  By
default, Denote uses its own custom hyperlink type which starts with
the <code>denote:</code> prefix.  In Org, it works like the <code>file:</code> type.  When
the user option <code>denote-link-use-org-id</code> is non-nil, links from Org
notes to other Org notes will use the standard <code>id:</code> type instead.  As
this is an Org-specific feature, Denote takes care to use the
major-mode-agnostic <code>denote:</code> type when the link targets a non-Org
note.</li>

<li><p>
In Org files the links created by Denote are buttonized automatically.
For Markdown and plain text, we use our own methods.  When a link is
inserted it is buttonized outright.  To buttonize links in existing
notes while visiting them in a buffer, add/evaluate this (it excludes
Org on its own):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (add-hook 'find-file-hook #'denote-link-buttonize-buffer)
</pre>
</div></li>

<li>The generation of the backlinks&rsquo; buffer now uses the built-in <code>xref</code>
library instead of relying on a hardcoded call to the <code>find</code>
executable.  This means that the <code>denote-link-backlinks</code> command will,
in principle, work properly with all Emacs builds.</li>

<li>Users of Emacs 28 or higher can configure <code>xref-search-program</code> to
change from the default <code>grep</code> to <code>ripgrep</code>, <code>ugrep</code>, or a
user-defined alternative.</li>

<li>This is the first stable release of Denote.  It covers close to 400
commits starting from 2022-06-04.  Denote is the successor to a toy
package of mine, USLS, whose first public version was made available
in early November 2020: <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/usls">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/usls</a>.</li>
