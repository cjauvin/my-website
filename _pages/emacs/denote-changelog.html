Fixed how references are analysed to produce the backlinks' buffer.
This should resolve the issue that some users faced where the
backlinks would not be produced.
</p>

<p>
The previous implementation would not yield the appropriate results if
(i) the value of the user option <code>denote-directory</code> was a "project"
per the built-in project.el and (ii) the link to the given entry was
from a subdirectory.  In short, the references were sometimes returned
as relative file paths, whereas they should always be absolute.
Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the feedback in issue 42 over

</p></li>

<li><p>
Addressed a regression in the function <code>denote-directory</code> (this is the
function that normalises the variable of the same name) which
prevented it from returning an expanded file path.  This too
contributed to problems with the backlinking facility.  Thanks to
Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the contribution in pull request 44 over
at the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/44">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/44</a>.

Also thanks to user pRot0ta1p for the relevant feedback in issue 43
(also on the mirror): <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/43">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/43</a>.
More thanks to Alfredo Borrás, Benjamin Kästner, and Sven Seebeck for
their comments in a related thread on the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3CCA73E705-1194-4324-9962-70708C4C72E5%40zoho.eu%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3CCA73E705-1194-4324-9962-70708C4C72E5%40zoho.eu%3E</a>.
These discussions showed we had a problem, which we managed to
identify.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Introduced the user option <code>denote-prompts</code> (read its doc string or
the relevant entry in the manual).  It governs how the standard
<code>denote</code> command for creating new notes will behave in interactive
usage.  By default, <code>denote</code> prompts for a title and keywords.  With
<code>denote-prompts</code>, the command can also ask for a file type (per
<code>denote-file-type</code>), subdirectory of the <code>denote-directory</code>, and a
specific date+time.  Prompts occur in the order they are specified.
Furthermore, the <code>denote-prompts</code> can be set to values which do not
include the title and keywords.  This means that the resulting file
names can be any of those permutations:
</p>

<pre class="example">
DATE.EXT
DATE--TITLE.EXT
DATE__KEYWORDS.EXT
</pre>


<p>
Recall that Denote's standard file-naming scheme is defined as follows
(read the manual for the details):
</p>

<pre class="example">
DATE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXT
</pre>


<p>
For our purposes, Denote will work perfectly fine for linking and
backlinking, even if file names do not include the <code>TITLE</code> and
<code>KEYWORDS</code> fields.  However, the user is advised to consider the
implications on usability: notes without a descriptive title and/or
useful keywords may be hard to filter and practically impossible to
manage at scale.  File names without such information should at least
be added to subdirectories which themselves have a descriptive name.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, Denote does not have strong opinions about one's
workflow.  The standard file name is the culmination of years of
experience.
</p>

<p>
Consider the <code>denote-prompts</code> the affirmative answer to the question
"Can keywords be optional?" as posed by Jack Baty on the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C8D392BC3-980A-4E5B-9480-D6A00BE8279F%40baty.net%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C8D392BC3-980A-4E5B-9480-D6A00BE8279F%40baty.net%3E</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the original contribution in
commit 9b981a2.  It was originally part of a pull request, but due to
some internal changes I had to merge it as a patch and technically the
web UI did not count the PR as "merged" (though it was in terms of
substance).
</p></li>

<li><p>
Refactored the <code>denote</code> command to (i) accommodate the new user option
<code>denote-prompts</code> via its interactive specification and (ii) be more
flexible when called from Lisp.  The latter scenario is for advanced
users or, generally, those who can maintain some custom code in their
configuration.  A case in point is one of the examples we show in the
manual for a programmatic way to create notes that automatically get
the <code>journal</code> tag:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (defun my-denote-journal ()
    "Create an entry tagged 'journal', while prompting for a title."
    (interactive)
    (denote
     (denote--title-prompt)
     '("journal")))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Notice that the <code>'("journal")</code> is a list of strings even for a single
keyword.  Whereas before a single one was a plain string.  This is a
breaking change.
</p>

<p>
Please consult the doc string of the <code>denote</code> command for the
technicalities.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Refashioned the interactive convenience functions of <code>denote-type</code>,
<code>denote-date</code>, <code>denote-subdirectory</code> to leverage the <code>denote-prompts</code>
user option while calling <code>denote</code> interactively.  In practical terms,
they no longer accept any arguments when called from Lisp.  Users who
need a programmatic approach are advised to either call <code>denote</code>
directly, or check how these commands <code>let</code> bind the <code>denote-prompts</code>
to carry out their operations.  The doc string of each command
explains how it works.  Or evaluate this to check the manual:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (info "(denote) Convenience commands for note creation")
</pre>
</div>

</p></li>

<li><p>
Documented how the user option <code>denote-directory</code> can accept a local
value.  This is pertinent to scenaria where the user needs to maintain
separate directories of notes.  By "separate" we mean sets of notes
that do not communicate with each other, cannot create links between
them, etc.  The manual delves into the technicalities.  If you have
the Info entry installed, evaluate:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (info "(denote) Maintain separate directories for notes")
</pre>

Thanks to user "Summer Emacs" for starting the discussion on the
mailing list, and Benjamin Kästner for their participation:

</p></li>

<li>Added an entry to the manual's Frequently Asked Questions about a
failed search for backlinks.  It includes sample code that users of
Windows can apply, if necessary.  (The error is not Denote's fault.)
Thanks to Benjamin Kästner for the patch, which is below the ~15 line
threshold and thus does not require copyright assignment to the Free
Software Foundation:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3Cce117b14-55cf-622e-6cd8-0af698091ae3%40gmail.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3Cce117b14-55cf-622e-6cd8-0af698091ae3%40gmail.com%3E</a>.</li>

<li>Removed duplicate entries from the list of file paths that the <code>xref</code>
library returns for the purposes of backlinking.  Thanks to
Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the contribution in pull request 44 on
the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/44">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/44</a>.</li>

<li>Applied an appropriate face to the backlinks' button to mitigate an
error.  Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the contribution in
pull request 45 on the GitHub mirror and for later testing a
subsequent tweak: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/45">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/45</a>.</li>

<li>Simplfied all the faces we define to make them work with all themes.
The previous colours were consistent with the <code>modus-themes</code>:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes</a>.</li>

<li>Refined how strings are sluggified under all circumstances.  Before, a
nil value for the user option <code>denote-allow-multi-word-keywords</code> would
have the adverse effect of joining all the strings in the title field
of the file name.  The intent always was to do that only for
multi-word keywords, not the title.  This change was part of a hotfix,
formalised as version <code>0.2.1</code> a day after the release of <code>0.2.0</code>.</li>

<li>Made the fontification rules more robust, while avoiding any false
positives.  This was done over a series of commits as it had
implications for the file name permutations that were mentioned
earlier.  Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the patches and/or
discussion about the merits of each change and concomitant
considerations:

<li>Rewrote all relevant entries in the manual to reflect all the
user-facing aspects of the aforementioned.</li>

<li><p>
Discussed a use-case of rewriting old journal entries as Denote-style
files.  As of this writing, we do not support migration of files in
bulk.  It might happen at some point, though it is no mean task.

<p>
An aside here as this topic was brought up: my packages are open to
users of all skill levels and is why I maintain a mailing list as well
as mirrors of the official git repository on SourceHut.  Do not
hesitate to ask a question.  If, for whatever reason, those
communication channels are not appropriate, you are welcome to contact
me in private: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/contact">https://protesilaos.com/contact</a>.

<li>Version <code>0.1.0</code> (from 2022-06-27) was never built as a package.  The
reason is that the GNU ELPA machinery reads the <code>Version:</code> header of
the main file, not the git tag.  As the original commit in <code>denote.el</code>
included <code>Version: 0.1.0</code>, GNU ELPA rightly tries to build the package
using that reference.  But because at that time I had not yet updated
the Copyright header to name the Free Software Foundation, the package
could not be prepared.  As such, please consider this release to be
the "first formal stable version".  My apologies for the delay,
contrary to what was promised in the last change log entry.

<li>Originally, Denote was designed to only work with notes in a flat
directory.  With code contributions from Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay,
support for subdirectories of the user option <code>denote-directory</code> is
now available.  This covers the case of creating links between notes,
following them, and viewing the backlinks' buffer of the current
entry.

</ul></li>

<li>From 2022-06-24 to 2022-07-03, Denote provided support for links
between Org notes that leveraged the <code>id:</code> hyperlink type.
Discussions on the mailing list and the GitHub mirror revealed the
longer-term problems in our implementation.  In the Annex below, I
provide my detailed opinion on the matter.  The gist is that Denote
does not&#x2014;and will not&#x2014;create <code>id:</code> links between its notes, but
shall use the <code>denote:</code> hyperlink type instead (which works like the
standard <code>file:</code> type).  As the Annex explains, Denote is not org-roam
lite and we try not to engender such false expectations.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Despite the fact that the relevant patches are no longer applicable,
I wish to thank Kaushal Modi and Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for their
contributions over at the GitHub mirror:

</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>
The user option <code>denote-date-format</code> controls how the date and time is
recorded in the file's contents (what we call "front matter").  When
nil (the default value), we use a file-type-specific format (also
check the user option <code>denote-file-type</code>):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For Org, an inactive timestamp is used, such as <code>[2022-06-30 Wed 15:31]</code>.</li>

<li>For Markdown, the RFC3339 standard is applied: <code>2022-06-30T15:48:00+03:00</code>.</li>

<li>For plain text, the format is that of ISO 8601: <code>2022-06-30</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the value is a string, ignore the above and use it instead.  The
string must include format specifiers for the date.  These are described
in the doc string of <code>format-time-string</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-date-format</code> supersedes the now obsolete
<code>denote-front-matter-date-format</code>.

</p></li>

<li>All the faces we define are now declared in the <code>denote-faces.el</code>
file.  The fontification rules are shared by <code>denote-dired-mode</code> and
the backlinks' buffer (invoked by <code>denote-link-backlinks</code> and
controlled by the user option <code>denote-link-fontify-backlinks</code>).  The
current list of faces:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>denote-faces-date</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-delimiter</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-extension</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-keywords</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-subdirectory</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-time</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-title</code></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Named the mailing list address as the <code>Maintainer:</code> of Denote.
Together with the other package headers, they help the user find our
primary sources and/or communication channels.  This change conforms
with work being done upstream in package.el by Philip Kaludercic.  I
was informed about it here:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/%3C875ykl84yi.fsf%40posteo.net%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/%3C875ykl84yi.fsf%40posteo.net%3E</a>.</li>

<li>Fixed how keywords are inferred and combined.  The previous code did not
work properly when the user option <code>denote-infer-keywords</code> was nil.
It would return a list of symbols, with the parentheses, whereas the
file name needs a string where each keyword is delimited by an
underscore.</li>

<li>Simplified how information in the front matter is retrieved.  It fixes
cases where, for example, a special character at the end of the title
was ignored.  Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the patch over at
the GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/21">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/21</a>.</li>

commit f35ef05cb451f265213c3aafc1e62c425b1ff043
Author: Protesilaos Stavrou &lt;info@protesilaos.com&gt;
Date:   Sun Jul 3 17:34:38 2022 +0300

    REMOVE support for 'id:' hyperlink types

    The original idea was to support the 'org-id' library on the premise
    that it makes Denote a good Emacs citizen.  However, discussions on the
    mailing list[0] and the GitHub mirror[1] have made it clear to me that
    'org-id' is not consistent with Denote's emphasis on simplicity.

    To support the way 'org-id' works, we will eventually have to develop
    some caching mechanism, just how the org-roam package does it.  This is
    because the variable 'org-id-extra-files' needs to be kept up-to-date
    whenever an operation on a file is performed.  At scale, this sort of
    monitoring requires specialised software.  Such a mechanism is outside
    the scope of Denote---if you need a db, use org-roam which is already
    great.

    [0] &lt;https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C8735fk4y1w.fsf%40hallac.net%3E#%3C877d4un73c.fsf@protesilaos.com%3E&gt;

    [1] &lt;https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/29&gt;

    Quote of what I wrote on the GitHub mirror issue 29:

            [ggjp] This is what I was implying.  That we are, in fact,
            providing an option that is not viable long-term, but keeping
            the option for expert users who will be able to handle this.
            And we should warn about this clearly in the doc of that option.

        [protesilaos] What you write here @ggjp and what @shrysr explained
        tells me that those expert users will need to be real experts.  To
        put it concretely, I am an experienced Emacs user with no
        programming background, who has written several Emacs
        packages (including the modus-themes which are built into Emacs),
        but I have zero knowledge of using a db or of handling things with
        python and the like.  So if I opt in to 'denote-link-use-org-id' I
        will eventually run into problems that my non-existent skills will
        prevent me from solving.  At that point, I will just use org-roam
        which already handles this use-case in a competent way (and has a
        massive community to rely on in case I need further support).

        If each package needs to write its own optimisations and maintain
        its own cache, to me this shows that 'org-id' is not good enough for
        the time being: more work needs to be done in org.git to provide a
        universal solution.

        I wanted to support 'org-id' by default on the premise that Denote
        must be a good Emacs citizen which interoperates with the rest of
        the wider ecosystem.  But if 'org-id' leaves something to be
        desired, then that goal is not worth pursuing: we add complexity to
        our code, offer an option that we cannot genuinely/adequately
        support, and make usage of it contingent on reading the docs and
        having a high level of expertise.

        I think being a good Emacs citizen is a laudable principle.  In this
        case, the right thing to do is to recommend the use of org-roam
        instead of trying to accommodate 'org-id'.  As such, I have now
        changed my mind and think we should remove what we previously added.

        For some context here: the reason I never used org-roam is
        because (i) it is Org-specific whereas I write notes in different
        file types and (ii) I did not want to ever rely on a db or
        equivalent dependency.

Followed up by my explanation:

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">&gt; can we not have denote style links to be default for (de)notes - and
&gt; explicitly supported, while if they need to, users can still link
&gt; denote org files via org-id to any other notes/files (and vice versa)
&gt; -- in which case performance + testing for org-id driven linking is
&gt; not within Denote's purview at all?

The formal support for `id:` links was added shortly before the release
of version `0.1.0`.  In the days prior, we supported what you describe
via the manual.  The user could change the `denote-org-front-matter`
variable to include a `PROPERTIES` drawer.  This possibility still
exists, though yesterday I removed the relevant entry from the manual.
This way only the real do-it-yourself experts will go down that path.

My concern here is with managing expectations.  If our Org notes are
superficially the same as org-roam's, an unsuspecting user may think
that Denote is an org-roam lite.  We will thus get issues/requests, such
as those already mentioned in this GitHub repo, about migrating from
org-roam to Denote.  While there are similarities, Denote is not a
minimalist org-roam and I would not like to encourage the idea of
treating the two as interchangeable.

Doing things half-way-through is a way to create false expectations.  A
package on GNU ELPA must be usable by users of all skill levels.  If the
functionality we provide is incomplete and needs to be covered by
user-level tweaks, we are excluding a portion of the user base while
still assuming the maintenance burden.  If someone trusts Denote to,
say, write a 1000 notes, we do not want to surprise them after the fact.
Imagine if the reported issues that triggered this change happened 6
months into one's daily usage of Denote: it wouldn't be nice.

Setting the right expectations is a matter of responsibility: we let the
user make a more informed choice and show respect for their time.  It
also makes it easier for me to keep Denote's scope in check by not
supporting every little extra that Org implements.  The premier Org
extension is org-roam: we do not need another one (or, if we do, I am
not the one to implement it).

* * *

Some comments on the `denote:` hyperlink type for Org as they may be
relevant in this context:

* It is meant to work like the standard `file:` type.  This means that
  it links to a file, while it can also have additional search
  parameters, as explained in the Org manual.  Evaluate:

      (info "(org) Search Options")

* It does not read the front matter, but only the file name.  You can
  create a note as usual, delete all its contents, save it, and try to
  link to it from another note.  It works.

* Exporting now works like the `file:` type for HTML, LaTeX, Texinfo,
  and Markdown.  Technically, it also supports the ASCII backend but the
  format of the output could be tweaked further.

There may be refinements to be made, which is okay as that is part of a
maintainer's duties.

<li>The <code>denote</code> package on GNU ELPA will be available a few hours after
this release.  GNU ELPA provides the latest stable release.  To use a

The front matter of notes in Org has changed to be compliant with the
standard <code>org-id</code> infrastructure.  A <code>PROPERTIES</code> drawer is added to
the top of the file, which includes an <code>ID</code> property with the value of
the Denote identifier.  Sample:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:          20220610T202537
  :END:
  #+title:      Sample Org front matter
  #+date:       2022-06-10
  #+filetags:   denote  testing
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
The front matter of Markdown (YAML or TOML) and plain text files
remains constant.  For completeness, this is how they look:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-md">   ---
   title:      "Sample with Markdown and YAML"
   date:       2022-06-10
   tags:       denote  testing
   identifier: "20220610T202021"

</pre>

  title      = "Sample with Markdown and TOML"
  date       = 2022-06-10

<li>The integration with <code>org-id</code> extends to how linking works.  By
default, Denote uses its own custom hyperlink type which starts with
the <code>denote:</code> prefix.  In Org, it works like the <code>file:</code> type.  When
the user option <code>denote-link-use-org-id</code> is non-nil, links from Org
notes to other Org notes will use the standard <code>id:</code> type instead.  As
this is an Org-specific feature, Denote takes care to use the
major-mode-agnostic <code>denote:</code> type when the link targets a non-Org
note.</li>

<li><p>
In Org files the links created by Denote are buttonized automatically.
For Markdown and plain text, we use our own methods.  When a link is
inserted it is buttonized outright.  To buttonize links in existing
notes while visiting them in a buffer, add/evaluate this (it excludes
Org on its own):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (add-hook 'find-file-hook #'denote-link-buttonize-buffer)
</pre>
</div></li>

<li>The generation of the backlinks' buffer now uses the built-in <code>xref</code>
library instead of relying on a hardcoded call to the <code>find</code>
executable.  This means that the <code>denote-link-backlinks</code> command will,
in principle, work properly with all Emacs builds.</li>

<li>Users of Emacs 28 or higher can configure <code>xref-search-program</code> to
change from the default <code>grep</code> to <code>ripgrep</code>, <code>ugrep</code>, or a
user-defined alternative.</li>

<li>This is the first stable release of Denote.  It covers close to 400
commits starting from 2022-06-04.  Denote is the successor to a toy
package of mine, USLS, whose first public version was made available
in early November 2020: <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/usls">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/usls</a>.</li>

<li>Thanks to everyone involved in the development of Denote.  Code
contributions, bug reports, discussion of ideas, are all valuable.
