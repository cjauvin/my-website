	  I often reply to emails and later think to myself: "hey, this
	  might be of interest to a wider audience".  If you ever wish to
	  ask me a question or hold a discussion about general life issues
	  and have it published here without any identifying information,
	  please <a href="https://protesilaos.com/contact">contact me</a>.
	  The publication can include the names of the people involved, or
	  it can be anonymous with potentially personally identifying
	  information edited out of the text---whatever you prefer.
