    <p>
        Tempus is a collection of themes for Vim, text editors, and
terminal emulators that are compliant at the very least with the WCAG AA
accessibility standard for colour contrast between background and
foreground values. This stands for a contrast ratio >= 4.5:1. Items of
the Tempus themes collection are either light or dark, while some of
them comply with the even higher accessibility standard of WCAG AAA,
else a contrast ratio >= 7:1.
