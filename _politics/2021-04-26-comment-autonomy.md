title: "Comment on collective autonomy"
excerpt: "My thoughts on personal and collective autonomy and freedom."

[Nathan Benedetto ProenÃ§a](https://www.ime.usp.br/~nathan/) added the
following comment to the video of my presentation on [Moral lessons from
free software and GNU
Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-04-16-emacs-moral-lessons/)
(2021-04-16).  I think this is worth sharing, so I asked for permission
to do so:

>Great talk, Prot!

>I do have a question.  When you talked about "geeks vs normies", you
>seemed to be talking more about emacs than autonomy in general.
>
>But talking about the general case, do you think it is normal to give up
>autonomy?  I believe that autonomy is the exception, precisely for its
>cost.
>
>Although I am autonomous with my computer, I am not with a car: I have
>no proper idea of it's inner workings and could not fix one without
>help.  For another example, I am not autonomously when I eat, as I live
>in the shadows of who grows the food.
>
>I have even read that democracy is about giving up autonomy, and even
>though I feel uncomfortable with this claim, I do not believe I have
>strong arguments to refute it.
>
>Sure, I agree and understand your point about "it's not binary", and
>that small steps matter more.  But when I contemplate all the
>manifestations of my heteronomy, I am forced to accept that they are the
>norm, and that I should choose wisely where to pay the cost for
>autonomy.

My reply is copied below.  For a more abstract approach, consider my
[Notes on
Rules](https://protesilaos.com/books/2020-07-01-notes-on-rules/)
(2020-07-01) as well as [On individuality and
partiality](https://protesilaos.com/books/2021-03-14-individuality-partiality/)

>an OS, and so on.  That would not be possible.  Plus, we could ask from
>where did such an individual gain all that knowledge and machinery from?
>They must have still benefited from a prior collective effort (prior

Thanks to Nathan for raising the question and agreeing to publish this
piece!
