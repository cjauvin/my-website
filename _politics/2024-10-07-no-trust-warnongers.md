excerpt: "Opinion piece about the jingoistic rhetoric in America and why continuous war is not a good policy."

Writing for _Jacobin_ magazine in an article titled [The Chicken Hawks
Want War With Iran](https://jacobin.com/2024/10/chicken-hawks-iran-israel-war/),
Liza Featherstone makes a trenchant critique of the warmongering class
in the United States:

> We could be on the brink of World War III. Israel assassinated a
> Hezbollah leader, Iran bombed Israel, Israel launched a ground
> invasion of Lebanon, and the United States deployed more troops and
> fighter jets to the Middle East. Israel won’t back down on Lebanon
> or Gaza, and both Israel and Iran have nuclear weapons.
>
> It’s scary — and a bipartisan chorus of nerds who probably couldn’t
> win a bar fight is eager to make it even scarier.

The final sentence is the key issue here. Forget about geopolitics and
ideological battle lines for a moment. War is simply not costly for
many of its proponents. They are part of an elite that is insulated
from the suffering and will in one way or another benefit from the
situation. They are shameless and unscrupulous in making a political
career out of jingoism while helping their corporate cronies earn a
profit from all the destruction they cause. The ones who will be
tasked to do the fighting typically are physically fit, working class
males.

The USA's decades-long policy of continuous warfare must be understood
as part of the symbiotic relationship between the state apparatus, the
military industry, and the financial establishment. War generates
debt, which entails a need for borrowing money that is done via the
issuance of yet more debt (government bonds), which is then marked as
a triple-A rated asset that works as collateral for other financial
derivatives. It is a lucrative business for those at the top and a
bottomless source of discomfort, pain, PTSD, or death for the rest.

In this light, the elites have a perverse incentive to always discover
a bugaboo somewhere that supposedly poses an existential threat to
Americans and their allies. Such is the twisted conduct of
imperialism: to continuously interfere in the affairs of countries
around the world and, when they unsurprisingly retaliate, to play the
victim and call for more war against such "terror".

The establishment will rump up the patriotic rhetoric to brainwash the
average lad into thinking that he has to fight for his country. Men
are hardwired or conditioned to protect those they love (whether this
is nature or nurture is beside the point) and the regime seeks to
exploit that disposition by turning it into a duty to forward the
agenda of imperialism.

When demagoguery fails, the authorities will resort to enlisting
people by force. Those who have the luxury to relocate to another
jurisdiction will flee, while the poorer folk will stay behind to be
integrated into the war machine. This is yet another expression of the
class divide that frames these phenomena.

The way of the gun is not the solution. Mental gymnastics such as
"deescalation through escalation" will simply engender more distaste
for the perpetrators, which will, in turn, all but guarantee future
armed conflicts.

Unless those loud warmongers are willing to lead by example in
fighting from the front lines, they cannot be trusted to have the
general good in mind.
