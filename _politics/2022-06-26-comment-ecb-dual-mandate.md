Writing on the _European Law Blog_, [Nuno Albuquerque Matos
elaborates](https://europeanlawblog.eu/2022/06/23/the-dual-primary-mandate-of-the-european-central-bank-between-inflation-and-eurozone-survival/)
on the European Central Bank's [June monetary policy
decisions](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2022/html/ecb.mp220609~122666c272.en.html).
The analysis centres on the predicament the ECB finds itself in as it
tries to (i) conform with its mandate of price stability in the face of
rising inflation while (ii) maintain its accommodative policy stance
which is necessary for the integrity of Europe's single currency:

I agree with the salient point: without the ECB's quantitative easing
the Eurozone would have collapsed under the weight of its own
contradictions and shortcomings.  As things currently stand, Member
States have conferred control over both macroeconomic policy levers to
the supranational level: (i) fiscal policy is formulated within the
confines of the European Semester (aka "Economic Governance") in
accordance with strict rules on debts, deficits, and pursuant to the
singleness of the Single Market, and (ii) monetary policy is trusted
with the ECB.  Governments thus lack the means to respond to economic
shocks in a manner that is beneficial to their domestic economy (given
the heterogeneity of national economies, such shocks are asymmetric).

Put concretely, a country cannot devalue its currency in an attempt to
ease its way out of a recession.  Similarly, the government cannot boost
the competitiveness of local businesses by shielding them from
competition as the rules of the single market strictly prohibit as much.
All things combined, the rigidity of the European Economic and Monetary
Union makes austerity a one-way street: the story of European affairs
since ~2010 in a nutshell.

The reason countries like Greece need the ECB's intervention in the
secondary bond markets is because it is impossible to exit a crisis by
austerity alone, as it deepens and prolongs the economic downturn.  If
you cut people's disposable income amid a recession, the government
earns fewer taxes, which does not help with its deficits, the national
product shrinks, which increases the debt to GDP ratio, investors see
the negative indicators which puts upward pressure on bond yields, thus
reinforcing the vicious cycle.

It can be said that foregoing sovereignty over both macroeconomic levers
is worth it as European integration provides other benefits.  At least
such was the thinking when the EMU was originally designed.  In the
2000s, these beliefs were plausible because no crisis was in sight.  The
fair weather construction of the Euro seemed to stand just fine.  Though
ever since the 2008+ financial calamity, things have taken a dramatic
turn for the worse.  We are dealing with crisis after crisis.  To claim
that some vague promise of an integrated Europe will address our woes is
more wishful thinking than practical guidance.

Europe is caught in the interregnum between the awkward
intergovernmentalism of the Maastricht Treaty (single currency but
decentralised governance) and a fully fledged European-level government
that is yet to be enacted.  The prospect of the latter is not in sight,
which implies that the legally and politically questionable policies of
the ECB will remain the norm for years to come.

On the legal front, it can be argued that the ECB's implicit duty to
preserve the integrity of the Euro Area springs from the singleness of
its mandate for price stability.  The precedent of the Outright Monetary
Transactions suggests as much.  It then remains to be determined whether
citizens will be satisfied which such a broadened interpretation of the
Treaties.  I remain of the view that OMT undermines the European value
of democracy, as the ECB---a technocratic body---was offering a _quid
pro quo_ to elected governments in exchange for "strict conditionality"
which is code language for enhanced austerity under the auspices of
another technocratic institution: the European Stability Mechanism.

One must then ask the all-too-important questions about the Economic and
Monetary Union: "who governs?" and "where is the locus of power?".  The
short version of the answers is that the European level is not
democratic.  The fact that we are discussing the ECB's self appointment
as protector of the Euro is sign that there is a power vacuum and the
concomitant absence of legitimacy/accountability.  Whether it is the ECB
or the institutions involved in the European Semester, Europe does not
have a proper government, a European treasury as a genuine counter-party
to the ECB, and all the legal arrangements an order of this sort
requires.

As such, and seen from the perspective of citizens in countries that are
dependant on the ECB's whims, the proposition of European integration,
manifesting in the current poorly designed architecture, is unappealing
(to say the least).  The choice is between austerity at home or
migration to some other country, such as to Germany.  And while the EU
makes the movement of people possible, this alone cannot be examined
without reference to the wider context: when you have to migrate in
order to survive, you are a refugee, legal technicalities
notwithstanding.  Besides, mass migration does not rectify the errors in
the institutional makeup of the Union: it compounds the existing
problems by adding the pernicious effects of brain drain on top of them.

Fundamentally, the EU is dealing with an inescapable dilemma.  Its
response is to dither and let the underlying malignancies fester.  There
will be a reckoning.  Does the EU want to be a union of largely
sovereign nation-states?  Then it needs to roll back the framework of
Economic Governance, abolish the Euro, and the like.  Alternatively,
does the EU aspire to be a fully fledged federal democracy?  Then it
needs to complement existing institutions with new ones so that the
integrity of the Union becomes a matter of democratic deliberation, not
be subject to the kind of bureaucratic calculus that happens behind
closed doors.  The untenable intermediate state we are in harms peoples
but also damages the otherwise laudable ambition of a united Europe.
