The [June 23-24 European Council
produced](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/24/european-council-conclusions-23-24-june-2022/)
the following conclusions on the matter of eastward EU enlargement:

> 10\. The European Council recognises the European perspective of
>     Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and Georgia. The future of these
>     countries and their citizens lies within the European Union.
> 
> 11\. The European Council has decided to grant the status of candidate
>     country to Ukraine and to the Republic of Moldova.
> 
> 12\. The Commission is invited to report to the Council on the
>     fulfilment of the conditions specified in the Commission’s
>     opinions on the respective membership applications as part of its
>     regular enlargement package. The Council will decide on further
>     steps once all these conditions are fully met.
> 
> 13\. The European Council is ready to grant the status of candidate
>     country to Georgia once the priorities specified in the
>     Commission’s opinion on Georgia’s membership application have been
>     addressed.
> 
> 14\. The progress of each country towards the European Union will
>     depend on its own merit in meeting the Copenhagen criteria, taking
>     into consideration the EU’s capacity to absorb new members.

While promises and commitments should not be given more weight than they
deserve, the statement of intent is clear while its timing is no
coincidence.  This is part of a concerted effort to challenge Russia on
all fronts.

The European Union has been acting as the informal political arm of NATO
in the region since the first days of the Ukraine affair and, generally,
through its eastward enlargement into former USSR countries, which
overlaps with NATO's own expansion in the area.  While Ukrainians
rightly see the ongoing conflict as a matter of self-defence and have
every right to oppose an aggressor, imperialist forces within NATO and
Russia know this is the current phase in a prolonged proxy war between
the two superpowers; a war that both sides are eager to escalate
further, on the Ukrainian front and beyond.

Russia's immediate geopolitical ambition is to create buffers at its
western borders, strengthen its presence in the Black Sea, and gradually
draw linkages between its holdings/alliances in Armenia, Syria, Libya to
expand its control southward and into the Mediterranean Sea.  NATO, on
the other hand, wants to push the Western sphere of influence further
into the European hinterland and towards the Caucasus to consolidate its
hegemony over the wider region.

Against this backdrop, the EU is pursuing its foreign policy with an eye
to achieve _integration in breadth_ without having first finalised
_integration in depth_.  Adding new members to a Union that has yet to
achieve homogeneity over a heteroclite collection of nation-states will
only amplify the existing tensions and divides.

The EU is a multi-tier construction at least since the Treaty of
Maastricht, where a union within a union was introduced: the monetary
union, else the Euro.  The contradictions of this "variable geometry",
as it is known, have not been reconciled to date.  There still is a
formal separation between Euro and non-Euro members, but also informal
ones such as the division of Euro Area countries into "core" and
"periphery" with the latter's participation in the single currency being
dependent on [continuous intervention from the European Central
Bank](https://protesilaos.com/politics/2022-06-26-comment-ecb-dual-mandate/).
There also exists the tandem of France and Germany, which is the de
facto driving force of European affairs and blithely [appropriates
Europe](https://protesilaos.com/politics/2020-09-28-appropriation-europe/)
in pursuit of its agenda.

Picking up a fight with Russia only guarantees that the much-needed work
to bring democracy to all levels of the EU architecture will be
postponed further.  The Union remains an incomplete edifice.  What
happens at the supranational level suffers from what I term a "mismatch
of sovereignty": we have rules (authority) for the system as a whole,
but lack the requisite fully fledged mechanisms of popular participation
and the overall accountability of decision-makers.

When, for example, the European Council adopts its decisions, there is
no singular entity which can be held accountable.  As citizens of
individual Member States, we can, in theory, voice our complaints
against our respective government, but European citizens cannot
challenge the European Council as such.  What the European Council
decides is a function of the balance of power between the Member
States---an intergovernmental affair---which inevitably results in
backstage horse trading that can be blamed on no-one in particular.

Asking the question of "who governs?" gives us unsatisfactory answers.
Is it the European Commission?  No.  And if it was, it remains an
unelected institution.  Is it the European Parliament?  Its competences
are broader than ever, but it cannot initiate legislation and must
co-decide with the Council of the EU (also not elected _as a body_).  Is
it the European Council?  No, not really because it does not exist as a
single entity.  Put concretely, you cannot vote the European Council out
of office _as a whole_.

The complexity and incompleteness of the EU contributes to an emergent
phenomenon where a collection of democracies (in principle) is not a
democracy unto itself.  It is not by accident or sheer coincidence that
the European Central Bank is the self-appointed protector of the Euro,
with no body of citizens capable of scrutinising it.  The locus of power
is found in technocratic arrangements and intergovernmental coalitions,
starting with the Franco-German tandem.

Minds are now concentrated on power politics, while bellicose rhetoric
prepares the stage for the inevitable formation of a European military
capacity; an army without a Europe-wide democracy bestowing upon it the
necessary legitimacy and accountability.

Europeans are quick to condemn Russia's weaponisation of food supply
chains, yet happily ignore how EU membership is instrumentalised in the
service of Western imperialism.  Enlargement should be preceded by the
deepening of integration between existing Member States in the interest
of instituting a European Democracy.  Instead, membership is used as a
means to promote foreign policy stratagems that serve NATO rather than
be conducive to the full realisation of European values within the EU.

A multi-tier EU makes it impossible to have a Union-wide demos.  The
system is so complex that only experts can make sense of it, while the
political realities of diverse countries necessitate that each case has
its own particularities and requires special treatment.  Such a state of
affairs favours a bifaceted approach to European affairs that
fundamentally caters to the interests of _Kerneuropa_ (core Europe):

1. Creating and/or strengthening technocratic institutions or mechanisms
   that enforce rules across the Union;

2. Keeping power away from citizens by diffusing the locus of authority
   between bureaucratic arrangements and intergovernmental structures.

While EU cheerleaders will pat themselves on the back for how righteous
the Union is for safeguarding "democracy", the fact of the matter is
that more work needs to be done at home before we can pontificate about
lofty ideals (and even then we do not have the right to hold the moral
high ground, but I digress).  For the time being, the crusade to bring
"European values" to other countries is misguided.  More so when it
provides grist to the mill of imperialism.
