I already started working on the land.  Assuming all goes well, the
project will last until the end of this year, with an estimated cost
of 7000 EUR.  It could have been done in a month, though I don't have
the money for it up front.  Plus, I will be putting in most of the
work, otherwise costs will rise out of control.  The end result won't
be pretty or comfy by conventional standards, but it will at least
give me something I can rely on (and maybe it will be pretty in the
long-run as I keep iterating on it).
