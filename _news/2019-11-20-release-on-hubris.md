title: 'New book: “On Hubris”'
excerpt: 'Announcement about my latest work in philosophy.'
---

I just published a new work on philosophy.  It examines some of the main
instances of human cockiness in the present era, how they are
rationalised and normalised.  The book is immediately available on my
website: [protesilaos.com/hubris](https://protesilaos.com/hubris).

_On Hubris_ is distributed free of charge and freed from traditional
copyright restrictions.  It is published under the terms of the Creative
