title: "My nomination for the Free Software Foundation (FSF) board"
excerpt: "Brief announcement on the fact that I am a nominee for the FSF's board."
---

A few weeks ago I was asked if I want to be nominated for the FSF
board.  This is a position that involves voluntary work in pursuit of
the ends of the foundation for the advancement of software freedom.  I
agreed to participate in the process and am eager to contribute to the
cause however I can.

The [announcement on the FSF website](https://www.fsf.org/news/announcing-the-fsfs-board-candidates)
lists the nominees and then outlines the next steps:

> [...] FSF associate members will ascertain the candidates' commitment
> to the fundamental requirements of the FSF mission, identify valuable
> attributes listed in the [board matrix](https://www.fsf.org/about/staff-and-board/board-matrix/),
> gauge whether the candidates will help the board fulfill its [overall
> role](https://www.fsf.org/about/the-role-of-the-fsfs-board-of-directors)
> in the Foundation, and whether they will fulfill a board member's
> [individual duties](https://www.fsf.org/about/board-member-agreement)
> in accordance with the [board code of ethics](https://www.fsf.org/about/board-of-directors-code-of-ethics).

There will be more follow.  Good luck to everyone.  May the greater
good be prioritised!
