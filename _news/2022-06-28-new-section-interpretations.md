I just created a new section on my website, which contains my
translations of---and comments on---works of art, typically Greek
songs.: <https://protesilaos.com/interpretations>.  It also has a
[dedicated RSS feed](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations.xml).

The first publication is a comment on a wonderful song: [Interpretation
of Alkinoos Ioannides' “Kathreftis”
(Mirror)](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2022-06-28-alkinoos-mirror/).
Expect more to follow (maybe even later today).
