In short, nothing to show for yet.

**UPDATE 2022-11-07 09:06 +0200:** I published a video where I explain
my problem and talk about my underwhelming CV:

Ever since August, I have a memo to leave the house I live in.  A new
memo has prompted me to make this public plea.  The landlord wants the
house for "private use".  I pay everything, so there is no legal
pressure for immediate action.  Though time is working against me and
I will not be able to stay here for much longer.  I have to be
decisive before the Spring of 2023 or Summer at the latest.

I reside in the Troodos mountain range of Cyprus.  When I first got
here, the cost of living was affordable.  I could survive on an
austere scheme of personal finances.  In the last three years or so,
rents in the area have at least doubled or tripled, while income has
remained stagnant.  What I have been doing is no longer sustainable.
I need a new job and place to stay.

I wish to migrate to another country in the European Union.  Cyprus is
simply too expensive for someone with no property.  The problem is
that I am trapped: I do not have enough savings to cover the startup
costs of relocation.  Any attempt at a job application is thus futile.

My local options are unsustainable.  I am publishing this in a
desperate attempt to find a solution or, at least, the conduit to one.

Please help me get in contact with an employer who would be willing to
assume my startup costs: plane tickets to my destination, ~2 months of
rent, 1 month of absolute essentials in living costs.  I will pay it
all back as soon as I start saving from my wage (e.g. within the first
6 months).  I do not ask for charity, but for an investment in me in
exchange for my medium-to-long term services.

I am alone and have a small suitcase of clothes.  I shall leave my dog
behind in the hands of someone I can trust.  My health is in peak
condition, while I know how to live frugally and independently.  There
are no hidden costs involved and I will not inconvenience anyone.

Some ideas of what I can do:

* Ancillary roles like office clerk.
* Pro-social activities such as educating people.
* Solo tasks of an intellectual sort, like writing reports, analyses.
* Manual labour such as construction, farming, bar tending.

I know how to program in Emacs Lisp.  This does not make me a fully
fledged programmer for the job market, though it shows I have the
basics and can learn more.

I speak Greek and English.  My French is also of a high level, though
I need some time of daily practice (e.g. 2 weeks) to rekindle my
memory of it.  My Spanish is good as well, but it needs some more work
to get me in the flow.

If you are reading this, you likely know about me through my
publications.  I work hard and never find excuses to skip my duties.
I will not disappoint whomever shows faith in me.

I am posting this in the "news" section of my website.  I do not know
if anyone will read it.  If it does not work, I will make the same
statement in video format on my YouTube channel.
