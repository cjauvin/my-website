title: "MAJOR CHANGES: Refactoring of the Books' section"
excerpt: "Information on the restructuring of the underlying code of the books' section of protesilaos.com"

I have just finalised the refactoring of [the books'
section](https://protesilaos.com/books).  Overview of the changes:

+ There is a new feed available at <https://protesilaos.com/books.xml>.
  In the past I would post in the News section (i.e. here and eventually
  on the `news.xml` feed) about any new publication.  That will no longer
  happen.  Follow the new `books.xml`.  If you need any help about web
  feeds, read [my RSS feed info page](https://protesilaos.com/feeds/) or
  [contact me](https://protesilaos.com/contact).
  
+ All old links/URLs have been instructed to redirect to new ones.  No
  further action is required of visitors to this website.  The old
  format was both unsustainable and uninformative.  For example, my
  _Notes on the Thinkable_, from 2013, had a URL that did not contain
  the date of publication or the placement of the entry inside the
  domain: `https://protesilaos.com/notes-on-the-thinkable-2-0`.  That
  was a historical accident from the time I was using a Wordpress blog
  and knew next to nothing about computers in general.  Now all URLs
  include the date of publication and the `books` specifier, like this:
  <http://protesilaos.com/books/2013-11-27-notes-on-the-thinkable/>.

+ All old books, like the _Little Guide to the European Union_ (2016)
  and _Structured Text on Sovereignty, Nationhood, Statehood_ (2018)
  have been consolidated into single files.  In the past, I would keep
  every chapter as a distinct file, each with its own metadata, which I
  thought was a neat idea.  But to make the book work like an index of
  standalone items, I had to manually create the "mini website" of each
  publication.  It involved several ad-hoc administrative tasks that I
  will not bother you with.  The gist is that now the act of publishing
  a book is as simple as publishing any entry: just a single file.  My
  only hope is that the consolidation went well and no data was lost in
  the transition (though I will conduct a review in the near future and
  I do have access to the version history).

Apart from subscribing to a new web feed, there is nothing you need to
do.  All those hours of work were necessary to fix problems that
accumulated over time; problems that were caused by my lack of knowledge
of how websites are pieced together.

While I did not bother to read everything again, I did study a few
passages.  Much of what I wrote is relevant today, though I do not care
about longer term consistency.  It is in the nature of the critical
thinker to be at odds with their previous self and to alienate former
sympathisers in the process.
