Just another video blog about my hut.  I have effectively closed the
construction.  It is good enough for summertime, though I still need
to do a lot more work ahead of the coming winter.  I was on a tight
schedule and could not wait any longer, thus prioritising the
essentials.  I will use a power generator for the time being, until I
can install solar panels.  The plan is to acquire kitchen appliances
and gradually bring everything up to a basic standard.

In this video I show the side of the building, the incomplete gate to
the place, the bay tree I planted, plus a pomegranate tree that
sprouted near the threshold.
