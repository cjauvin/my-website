In this ~7 minute video I show part of the work I am doing to set up a
cabin made out of discarded doors.  I got those doors free of charge
from a junk yard: they were sent there to be destroyed.  The idea is
to put them together into a sturdy construction that will house the
instruments of my hut's electricity setup.  I want to have these
instruments outside the main building for safety reasons and to keep a
separation of concerns (same reason why the water cabin is separate as
well).  I am eagerly waiting to have electricity at the hut so I can
finally have Internet there and be up and running with all my
web-related activities.  It's a matter of days!
