**UPDATE 2021-08-27 15:27 +0300:** I am back with a new desktop
computer.  More to follow in newer publications.

About ten days ago [my laptop's battery stopped
recharging](https://protesilaos.com/news/2021-08-05-laptop-battery/).
The machine cannot work without it even if I keep it plugged, so I have
not had a personal computer ever since.

Now I am writing this from the office of the local commune:

+ While there are over 700+ messages in my inbox, I noticed several
  donations over the past few days.  The amount I have received is a bit
  over **EUR 430**.  Wow!  That is more than I have received in all of
  the previous years combined!

+ I do not know how that happened and will reply to each person once I
  get the chance.  Though I must first regain access to Emacs+Notmuch,
  otherwise the email correspondence is not manageable.  All I can do at
  this point is thank everyone and promise to do my best once I'm
  available.

+ I was searching for battery replacements and was disappointed with my
  findings.  No local provider has any, while online offers, such as on
  ebay, have exorbitant shipping costs (e.g. EUR 40-60 for the battery
  and over EUR 100 to send it to Cyprus).  That would cost more than the
  laptop itself.  Also, I read that not all batteries are made equal in
  terms of reliability.  It is risky.

+ The donation money changes my plan A: I will search for hardware to
  either build a desktop computer or buy a mini tower.  Whatever is
  available here.  I am not particularly knowledgeable about computer
  components and will need to learn more before committing to any
  option.  If this does not yield results, I will go with the plan B of
  buying a battery.

Hopefully I will be back in action within the next 3 weeks.  Unless
something major changes, I will not post a new announcement but will
just edit this one instead.  That is because I will get back to
publishing what I usually do: I have written a couple of manuscripts
already and would like to do at least one new Emacs-related video.
