title: 'Renamed "advice" section to "commentary"'
excerpt: 'Announcement about the renaming of a section of my website that used to be about "life advice".'
---

On 2021-11-06, I created a new section on my website which I described
as being about "life advice" (read [the
announcement](https://protesilaos.com/news/2021-11-06-new-section-life-advice/)).
I now realise this was a poor choice of words, as it can give the
impression that there is a relationship between some master and a
student or, else, between unequal parties.  Such was never my intention:
I am no master, no expert, no guru or whatever, and have no intention to
be considered in those terms.  I just speak my mind.  So please accept
my apologies!

The section is now titled "General commentary on life".  All URLs have
been edited to omit the `/advice` path and instead point to
`/commentary`.  Redicects have been installed accordingly, so users
visiting an old link should be taken to its new destination.

However, it is likely that the old RSS feed is broken and users will
have to manually update their sources.  The old URL was:
<https://protesilaos.com/advice.xml>.  The new one must be:
<https://protesilaos.com/commentary.xml>.
