excerpt: "About the technical problems I had with my email setup. Those who sent me a message in the past few days will need to resend it."

I recently changed my email service provider. Overall, I am happy with
the results. There was, however, one major area that I underestimated:
the server-side spam policy. Their default settings are quite
aggressive in rejecting messages.

I am aware of four cases where this has happened: two were GitHub
notifications related to my Emacs packages and the other two were from
people I frequently correspond with.

I have now revised all the relevant settings and am, hopefully, able
to receive every legitimate email. If you sent me a message in the
past week or so and I did not reply to it, then I most probably never
got it. Please send it again.
