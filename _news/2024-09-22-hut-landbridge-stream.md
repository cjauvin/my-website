In this ~15-minute video I show the flood control work I have been
doing to keep the nearby stream away from my land and to thus be safe
long-term. Part of this project involves the creation of a bulwark
that consists of rocks, soil, and strategically planted canes or
trees. There is still much more work for me to do and I continue with
the same commitment and enthusiasm I had when I started.
