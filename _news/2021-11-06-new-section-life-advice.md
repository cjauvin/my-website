title: 'New section on the website about "life advice"'
excerpt: "Announcement about a new section on my website, which contains my answers to questions about general life issues."

I just created a new section on my website, which contains my answers to
questions I received about general life issues:
<https://protesilaos.com/advice>.  It also has a [dedicated RSS
feed](https://protesilaos.com/advice.xml).

As I note in the new section's index page:

> I often reply to emails and later think to myself: "hey, this might be
> interest to a wider audience". If you ever wish to ask me a question
> about general life issues and have it published here without any
> identifying information, please [contact

The first post I have published there concerns the frame of mind we
ought to have in assessing the end and the means used to pursue it.  The
case in point concerns university studies and the prospects of a career:
