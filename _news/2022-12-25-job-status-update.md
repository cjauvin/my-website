title: "Status update on job search and relocation"
excerpt: "A brief summary of my search for a job and the need to relocate away from Cyprus."

This is a follow-up to my recent status updates on my search for a
permanent job and option of moving countries.

## State of affairs

I live in the Troodos mountains of Cyprus.  When I first arrived here
rent was cheap and I could survive on a tiny budget.

Due to a number of factors, including the pandemic, the war in
Ukraine, the ramifications of Cyprus "golden visas" scheme, plus other
domestic housing market dynamics, the cost of living has risen to
prohibitive levels.  My previous lifestyle is unsustainable while my
landlord wants me to evacuate the house as soon as possible (initially
warned me in August 2022 and has sent more memoranda since), thus
forcing me to find another place where rent will be three, four, or
more times the current rate.

Cyprus simply is too expensive for anyone who doesn't own property.
It's employment market is also not offering enough opportunities.

## Progress on finding a job

As I mentioned in [my last status
update](https://protesilaos.com/news/2022-11-15-job-status-update-clojure-propsect/),
I got a small renumerable Emacs-related task.  _This was not a
full-time job_ but only a one-off project that I fulfilled at the
start of December.  Nothing has changed: I still need a job and will
have to change countries.

~~Currently, I am in contact with a prospective employer.  I do not know
what will come out of it, given my irregular skill set.  I will write
more when I have results: maybe some time in early 2023.  There is no
point in publishing scenaria.~~ **UPDATE 2023-01-07 05:35 +0200**: I
keep searching.

## Commitment to Clojure

I wanted to specialise in Clojure and studied it, though I will have
to revise this decision by putting it on hold for the time being.
Most of those who contacted me with potential employment opportunities
recommended different languages.  Job postings also send the same
clear signal.

I like Clojure for reasons I have explained in the previous
announcement, but I must prioritise immediate results: I will focus on
whatever makes me suitable for a job, given available demand.
