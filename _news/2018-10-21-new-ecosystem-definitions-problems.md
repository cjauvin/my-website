excerpt: 'Announcement about my latest philosophical work on the possibility of universal interconnectedness.'

I published a new essay on philosophy: [Ecosystem: definitions and
problems](https://protesilaos.com/ecosystem-definitions-problems/). It tackles the idea of an
ecosystem as one of "universal interconnectedness", examining the
problems that arise from it.

As with all publications on [my website](/), *Ecosystem: definitions and
problems* is distributed free of charge and freed from traditional
