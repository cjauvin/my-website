In this video I show the solar panels and the "electricity cabin", as
I call it, which I made out of old doors.

I got the off-grid electricity setup last night.  I can finally get
back to my Internet-related activities (coaching, Emacs packages,
etc.).  Sorry for the delays: I am back in action and as eager as
ever.
