I just published a new work on philosophy.  This is a series of notes,
structured text if you will, that examines the mechanics of rules,
institutions, social organisation and governance in abstract.  The book
is immediately available on my website:
[protesilaos.com/notes-on-rules/](https://protesilaos.com/notes-on-rules/).

_Notes on Rules_ is distributed free of charge and freed from
