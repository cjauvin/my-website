In this ~50 minute video, I show part of the work I am doing to clear
the path that leads to the stream close to my hut. The idea is to do
the necessary anti-soil-erosion work and to clean all the rubbish from
the stream. This is a multi-day project and I am happy to make
progress one step at a time. In the process, I am rescuing
fruit-bearing trees and I plan to plant other trees.
