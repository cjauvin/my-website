Another brief video update on my initiative to build a hut in the
mountains of Cyprus.  I am collecting stones to cover the surface area
of the foundation.  The idea is to economise on the amount of concrete
I need.  I must do that to have enough money for the expenses.
Collecting stones is time-consuming, but at least they are free of
charge.  Plus, I get the chance to explore the area, such as the
nearby river.
