Today was a big day for my initiative to build a hut in the mountains
of Cyprus.  I finalised the work for the foundation.  The video I
prepared has me talk about it a bit more and show a few things.
Basically, this is the culmination of months of work though there is
more to go.  I am not sure when the next phase in the construction
work will commence.  Hopefully soon!

My immediate priority is to get some rest.  The past few weeks have
been intense: I have been working on the hut, often for several hours
under the sun, in addition to all the tasks I was already doing.  I
now _look_ tired...
