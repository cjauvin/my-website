**UPDATE 2022-11-12 07:49 +0200**: Read [the status update on my job
search](https://protesilaos.com/news/2022-11-12-job-status-update/).
In short, nothing to show for yet.

This video is my public plea to find employment.  It comes with an
explanation of why I am in this situation and why my CV is
underwhelming/useless.

This is a follow-up to the announcement I made on Saturday about
finding a job and relocating:
<https://protesilaos.com/news/2022-11-05-help-me-find-job-move-country/>.

If you know of an employer who can put faith in me and help me get
started, please put me in contact with them.  **Any job** that pays
the bills will suffice, as I also explained in my previous
publication.

I have no-one to vouch for me and no formal certification that
improves my chances or otherwise flatters me.  I can only trust in the
human factor.

If you cannot help, don't worry about it: I am prepared for all
possible outcomes and understand the implications.
