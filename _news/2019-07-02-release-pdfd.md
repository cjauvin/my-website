title: 'Official release of PDFD'
excerpt: 'The book for reproducing my custom desktop session on Debian 10 Buster is officially out of the beta/testing phase.'
---

On April 25, I published the first beta version of "Prot's Dots For
Debian" (PDFD).  Since then I made a series of incremental refinements
and changes.  PDFD is a complete guide to reproducing my custom desktop
session on Debian 10 'buster'.  Today I added the finishing touches and
am happy to announce that the first official release is available.

I am publishing this a few days prior to the release of Debian 10, which
will happen on July 6, just to be sure that everything works as
intended.
