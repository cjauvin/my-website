title: 'New publication: "Scepticism as a type of certitude"'
excerpt: 'Announcement about my latest philosophical work on scepticism'
---

I published a new essay on philosophy: [Scepticism as a type of
certitude](https://protesilaos.com/scepticism-certitude/).  It explores the probl√©matique of
whether scepticism is a kind of certainty and, if so, how to
differentiate between different statements that are made in certitude.

certitude* is distributed free of charge and freed from traditional
