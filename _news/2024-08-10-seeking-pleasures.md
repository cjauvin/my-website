In this hour-long video I talk about how it is okay to pursue
pleasures when we do it with moderation. I explain how
pleasure-seeking can be the conduit to learn new things about our
selves and to broaden our understanding of the world. I thus cover
themes of longer-term commitment, of finding sustainable experiences,
and of not being opportunistic or haphazard in your choices. Finally,
most of this video show a first-person view of the mountain paths I am
traversing on this nice, sunny day.
