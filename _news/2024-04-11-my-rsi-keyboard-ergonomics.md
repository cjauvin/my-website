In this ~40-minute video I talk about the injury in my arm/wrist
caused by my old keyboard and desk setup. I then discuss programmable,
mechanical keyboards and the ergonomics involved.

Thanks to Arialdo Martini for gifting me the Keychron K5 Pro and for
helping me get started with mechanical+programmable keyboards.

Thanks to "Andreas" whose generous donation allowed me to buy the Iris
keyboard (revision 8) from keeb.io

## Screenshots of my Iris layers

Remember that this is a work-in-progress. I already experimented with
a few arrangements. These ones feel comfortable. Note that the `Menu`
(`RApp`) key functions as the `Compose` on Linux.

These are layers 0 to 3.
