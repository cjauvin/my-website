In this ~40-minute video I talk about the injury in my arm/wrist
caused by my old keyboard and desk setup. I then discuss programmable,
mechanical keyboards and the ergonomics involved.

Thanks to Arialdo Martini for gifting me the Keychron K5 Pro and for
helping me get started with mechanical+programmable keyboards.

Thanks to "Andreas" whose generous donation allowed me to buy the Iris
keyboard (revision 8) from keeb.io
