excerpt: "Link to my new Signal account. This is my Plan B for communication, in case email fails."

The [recent trouble I had with my email setup](https://protesilaos.com/news/2024-11-24-technical-email-problems/) has forced me to reconsider my communication strategy. I must have a Plan B. Even though I still do not like using my phone for productivity, I have to make this concession. You can thus find me on the Signal app: <https://signal.me/#eu/AKio-VMi3643Lv6iuEAgrteICHl-cj14BPjVXKGhuSd7WewEnb1OA7BQx6-4Dsnv>.

Note that email is still my preferred method of communication. I would hate to type on the phone. I will do it, if necessary, but will not provide the kind of lengthy/complete answer I do via email.
