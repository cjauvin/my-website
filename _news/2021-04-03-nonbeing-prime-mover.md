excerpt: 'Information about my latest philosophical work on metaphysics.'

Just published a philosophical work: [On non-Being and the prime
mover](https://protesilaos.com/nonbeing-prime-mover/).  This is a work
on metaphysics where I wrestle with some problems of nothingness and
universal interconnectedness.
