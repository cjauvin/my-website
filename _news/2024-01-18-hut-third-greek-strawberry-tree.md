In this video status update, I show the new tree I planted today. It
was a sunny morning after several days of rainfall, so I took the
opportunity to bring home a Greek strawberry tree that I found near a
place known as the cliff of Hera.

This is the third tree of its kind that I have planted around my hut.
Since I did not do a video about the second one, I show it in this
video. The plan is to have more such trees, grafted from the third
one, which I will plant throughout the valley.
