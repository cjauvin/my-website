This video is another status update on my initiative to build a hut in
the mountains of Cyprus.  I cleared the spot where the solar panels
will eventually be installed.

It is a lot of hard work, though I am making good progress.  As I
mention in the video, I hope to have the basic shelter done by the end
of next week.  The place will still leave much to be desired, though I
have no alternative: everything else will have to come later.
