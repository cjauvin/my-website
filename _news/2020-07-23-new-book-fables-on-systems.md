title: 'New book: “Fables on Systems”'
excerpt: 'Announcement about my latest work on philosophy.'
---

I just published a new work on philosophy, which consists of a series of
imaginary stories.  Quoting from the introduction:

>It is customary to associate fables with children.  Doing so in this
>case would be presumptuous, for it would assume that (i) adults are
>readily aware of the issues raised herein, and (ii) that imaginary
>scenaria are didactic for kids in a way they are not for other age
>groups.  Let us avoid such pitfalls.
>
>This is a work on philosophy.  The characters and events are imaginary,
>though I could just as well write about actual stories that would still
>convey the same ideas you are about to read.  What matters is the set of
>insights one can draw from each fable individually and from all of them
>taken as a unit.
>
>You can read these chapters in any given order, though I have provided
>for a loosely sequential progression that could help streamline their
>teachings.

The book is immediately available on my website:
