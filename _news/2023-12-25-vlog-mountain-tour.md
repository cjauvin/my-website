In this one-hour video I do a first person tour of my mountains, while
talking about philosophical themes. I climb the mountain, showing you
its beautiful slopes and biodiversity.

As I walk, I talk about philosophical themes:

- Accept how things stand and appreciate what you have.
- Holidays are an opportunity to recognise what is available to us.
- What rituals can teach us, provided we do them in earnest.
- About putting both the mind and body to work.
- How we are not just spiritual or rational agents.
- The beauty of the world and how the natural surrounding provide an
  outlet for all facets of our being.
