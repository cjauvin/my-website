In this video I explain what has transpired since my last vlog entry,
which was [my public plea for help in finding a
job](https://protesilaos.com/news/2022-11-07-job-help-cv-story/):

* I have a short-term project to work on.  It is related to Emacs.  I
  will publish more about it in the near future on my website's coding
  blog section.
* This small job pays some money that I will use for the next few
  weeks.  It gives me a modicum of stability.
* I also received some donations.  Again, they provide some immediate
  relief.
* The underlying problem is the same: I need a job and I will have to
  relocate.  But now I am not desperate to accept the first offer that
  comes my way.
* I do not want to adopt a decision about my future under extreme
  duress.  It has to be something I will not regret.
* I started learning Clojure and I explain why I picked it over
  Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and Common Lisp.  In short: (i) there is
  sufficient demand for it, (ii) it provides a Lisp conduit to the
  worlds of Java and JavaScript, (iii) the members of the community
  who contacted me are very passionate about this language, which
  excites me.
* I think Clojure has this Emacs-y quality where the members of its
  community care about the qualitative aspects of their craft.  At
  least based on the feedback I received.
* I am reading books and am setting up Emacs with `clojure-mode` and
  `cider`.  The plan is to start writing real code, like toy programs,
  which will help me understand how things work in practice.
* I explain what I learnt about my CV and how the tech industry does
  not care so much about formal qualifications.  I still rely on the
  human factor though.
* Brief comment on all the messages I have received and how I am still
  replying to each of them.  It takes time.
* Some words about offers I cannot accept.
* Closing thoughts with a philosophical point about not relying on
  appearances.
