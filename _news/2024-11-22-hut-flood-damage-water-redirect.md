In this video I show the damage caused by the heavy rainfall. My
network of pipers is broken and I need to rebuild the dam I had, which
was collecting water and channeling it to my place. Part of the land
was eroded by the flood and I show the work I am doing to redirect the
stream so that it does not cause further damage. At the end of the
video I make some comments of a more general nature about letting your
deeds do the talking.
