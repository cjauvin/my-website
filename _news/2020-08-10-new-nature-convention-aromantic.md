title: 'New publication: “On the nature-convention divide”'
excerpt: 'Information about my latest philosophical work on the ontology of pragmata and chrēmata in the peculiar case of human nature.'
---

Just published an essay titled [On the nature-convention
divide](https://protesilaos.com/nature-convention-aromantic/) and
subtitled "With aromanticism as a case study".  This is a work on
ontology and related epistemics concerned with the distinction between
pragmata and chrēmata in the particular case of human nature.
Aromanticism is offered as a tangible example for the sake of not
appearing too abstract.
