title: 'Breaking change: manually update politics feed'
excerpt: 'I have repurposed my politics blog. The old RSS feed no longer works.'
---

I have completed all the internal changes that were necessary for the
transition to my [new political writings section](https://protesilaos.com/politics/).  It
supersedes the old blog that was focused on European Union politics.

Subscribers must update their RSS reader to point to the new feed,
available at: [https://protesilaos.com/politics.xml](/politics.xml).

The **old feed no longer works** and contains no content whatsoever.

For further questions, please [contact me](https://protesilaos.com/contact/).
