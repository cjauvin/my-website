title: "New book: Prot's Dots For Debian"
excerpt: 'Announcement about my latest book on free/libre software.'
---

I just published a book about free/libre software.  This is a full guide
to reproducing my custom desktop session (my dotfiles) on Debian 10
'buster'.

As noted in the book, the period prior to the official release of Debian
10 is considered a "beta" phase and is only meant to be used by testers
or early adopters.  PDFD will exit beta once 'buster' is out (expected
in the summer of 2019)â€”at which point I will make the necessary
adjustments to the book's contents.

_Prot's Dots For Debian_ (PDFD) is available free of charge and freed
from traditional copyright restrictions.  It is distributed under the
terms of the _Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike Licence (CC BY-SA)
4.0_.  Its code is licensed in the same spirit using the _GNU General
Public License version 3 or later_.

You can [read the book online](https://protesilaos.com/pdfd/) or visit its [print-optimised
page](https://protesilaos.com/pdfd/print/) to get a physical copy.

Because this is code-related, I assume that readers will have the
minimum technical skills to also make use of the following `git`
repositories (contributions are most welcome):

* [PDFD source files](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pdfd) with
  instructions on how to get a local markdown file with the book.
* [Code for PDFD](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/cpdfd) containing the
  latest "fixed release" of my dotfiles.
* [My dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles).
