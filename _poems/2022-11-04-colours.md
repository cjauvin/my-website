**UPDATE 2022-11-05 05:52 +0200:** This was originally posted in
[Interpretations and critiques](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/).  Now it is part
of a dedicated section on my poetry.

Here is just another poem of mine.  The second I ever wrote.  As with
[Olives](https://protesilaos.com/poems/2022-11-03-olives/),
I composed it in one go and did not tend to its aesthetic appeal.  It
is authentic me.

```
Blue or green
memento of a Summer gone

Black or grey
reminder of sweet delusion
```
