**UPDATE 2022-11-05 05:50 +0200:** This was originally posted in
[Interpretations and critiques](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/).  Now it is part
of a dedicated section on my poetry.

Though this section is about my philosophical interpretation of works
of art, what follows has no commentary.  It is my first ever poem.  I
just wrote it in one go and consider it complete.

```
Today's olives
taste unlike yesterday's
Years thus pass

Dear caring mind
you varied the routine
But I noticed
```
