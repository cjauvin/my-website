title: "Emacs: cursory version 0.2.0"
excerpt: 'Information about the latest version of my Cursory package for GNU Emacs.'
---

Cursory provides a thin wrapper around built-in variables that affect
the style of the Emacs cursor.  The intent is to allow the user to
define preset configurations such as "block with slow blinking" or "bar
with fast blinking" and set them on demand.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `cursory`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/cursory>
+ Git repo on SourceHut: <https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/cursory>
  - Mirrors:
    + GitHub: <https://github.com/protesilaos/cursory>
    + GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/cursory>
+ Mailing list: <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/cursory>

Below are the release notes.

* * *

This is a stability release that introduces minor tweaks while
formalising point releases which were already available to users.

-   When there is only one preset defined in the user option
    `cursory-presets` the command `cursory-set-preset` will not prompt for
    completion.  It will apply the sole preset outright.

-   Simplified the sample code in the manual for restoring the last preset
    after starting Emacs.  The code is now written as follows:
    
        ;; Set last preset or fall back to desired style from `cursory-presets'.
        (cursory-set-preset (or (cursory-restore-latest-preset) 'bar))
    
    Thanks to Christopher League for the original idea over at the
    `fontaine` mailing list (Fontaine is another package of mine):
    <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/fontaine/%3C87sfpop0dm.fsf@contrapunctus.net%3E#%3C87pmksoyv6.fsf@contrapunctus.net%3E>

-   Simplified the value of the `cursory-presets` user option.  It now
    looks like this:
    
        '((bar
           :cursor-type (bar . 2)
           :cursor-in-non-selected-windows hollow
           :blink-cursor-blinks 10
           :blink-cursor-interval 0.5
           :blink-cursor-delay 0.2)
          (box
           :cursor-type box
           :cursor-in-non-selected-windows hollow
           :blink-cursor-blinks 10
           :blink-cursor-interval 0.5
           :blink-cursor-delay 0.2)
          (underscore
           :cursor-type (hbar . 3)
           :cursor-in-non-selected-windows hollow
           :blink-cursor-blinks 50
           :blink-cursor-interval 0.2
           :blink-cursor-delay 0.2))
    
    Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for the patch.

-   Fixed the `:type` of the `cursory-presets` declaration.  The Custom UI
    should now be able to read all values properly.  Courtesy of Philip
    Kaludercic.

-   Named the mailing list address as the `Maintainer:` of Cursory.
    Together with the other package headers, it helps the user find our
    primary sources.  This is to conform with work being done in
    package.el by Philip Kaludercic.  I was informed about it here:
    <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/%3C875ykl84yi.fsf%40posteo.net%3E>.

-   Included a reference to the "devel" version of GNU ELPA.  My blog post
    covers the technicalities: <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-05-13-emacs-elpa-devel/>.

-   Mentioned in the manual the `electric-cursor` package.  The text reads
    thus:
    
    > The `electric-cursor` package by Case Duckworth lets the user
    > automatically change the cursor style when a certain mode is activated.
    > For example, the box is the default and switches to a bar when
    > `overwrite-mode` is on: <https://github.com/duckwork/electric-cursor>.
