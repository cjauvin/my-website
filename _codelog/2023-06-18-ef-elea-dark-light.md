title: "Emacs: introduction to the ef-themes “Elea” variants"
excerpt: "I added a new pair of dark and light themes to my 'ef-themes' collection.  They are quite different from the rest of the collection."
---

The `ef-elea-light` and `ef-elea-dark` themes are now part of the
development version of the `ef-themes` package.  Both are special
among the Ef themes in that they use more pronounced background
colours combined with subdued foregrounds.

The new themes take their name from the Greek word for "olive".  Their
effective colours are based on those of olive trees: a common sight
across the Mediterranean region.

Sample pictures are shown below.  Also check the entire set:

## Coming in version 1.2.0 (next stable release)

Both themes are essentially complete.  I may still tweak them a
little bit, though nothing that would refashion them.

The `ef-themes` are a collection of light and dark themes for GNU Emacs
whose goal is to provide colorful ("pretty") yet legible options for
users who want something with a bit more flair than the `modus-themes`
(also designed by me).
