In this video I showcase the main features and workflows of `vc`.  This
is a generic framework that can be used with several version control
systems, one of which is `git`.

I am using VC in parallel with the more powerful `magit`.  The former is
for smaller, simpler operations.  The latter is for the advanced
features that `git` provides.

Check [my dotemacs](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs) for all relevant
configurations.
