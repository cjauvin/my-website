title: "Emacs: beframe version 1.0.0"
excerpt: 'Information about the latest version of my beframe package for GNU Emacs.'
---

`beframe` enables a frame-oriented Emacs workflow where each frame has
access to the list of buffers visited therein.  In the interest of
brevity, we call buffers that belong to frames "beframed".

Below are the release notes

* * *

`beframe` is in a stable state. This release formalises a set of
stability enhancements and quality-of-life improvements.


## The menu bar helps you discover Beframe commands

A submenu with Beframe commands is available to users of
`menu-bar-mode`. It is available at `Buffers > BEFRAME buffers`. Check
the original announcement, which includes screenshots:
<https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-10-08-emacs-beframe-menu/>.

[ As an aside, never tell a new user to add `(menu-bar-mode -1)` to
  their Emacs init file. It is not helpful. ]


## The sample integration with `consult` can flip between recent buffers

In the manual of `beframe` there is a section about augmenting the
`consult-buffer` command with a new source of beframed buffers
(buffers specific to the current frame). Edgar Vincent made a change
that sorts buffers by last viewed, meaning that the previous buffer is
at the top of the list. The change is within the ~15 line limit and
thus Edgar does not need to assign copyright to the Free Software
Foundation. Discussed on the mailing list:
<https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/%3C878r97fxmc.fsf%40protesilaos.com%3E>.

Refer to the manual for the code to integrate `beframe` with `consult`:
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/beframe#h:1c2d3d64-aa7b-4585-a418-ccedbb548b38>.

NOTE that you do not need `consult` to use `beframe`: (i) the
`beframe-mode` makes the regular `switch-to-buffer` work in a beframed
way and/or (ii) use the `beframe-buffer-menu` to get a list of the
beframed buffers (call the latter command with a prefix key (`C-u` by
default) to select a frame whose buffers you want to list).


## The `beframe-rename-function` can take a `nil` value

This was always the intent, though the code did not honour it. Thanks
to Karthik Chikmagalur for reporting the bug on the mailing list:
<https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/%3C87a5w8yi1n.fsf%40gmail.com%3E>.


## General refinements

-   Commands that prompt for a frame (e.g. `beframe-assume-frame-buffers`)
    no longer try to perform their work if a single Emacs frame is
    available. Instead, they return a `user-error`.

-   The buffer that was current when a new frame was created is no
    longer part of the new frame's buffer list. This means that the new
    frame starts clean, including only the buffer specified in the user
    option `beframe-global-buffers`.

-   The code that renames a new frame based is better at inferring the
    correct name. It now finds the `project.el` name, if available. The
    manual explains how to use Beframe with projects:
    <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/beframe#h:5b751614-8749-4aa8-aaed-f181beaddc57>
    (to me, this is a killer feature).

-   Simplified how frames are set up. This guarantees that our functions
    are called in the desired order.
