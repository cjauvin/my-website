In this screen cast I announce the first stable release of my highly
accessible themes.

There are two items: a light and a dark.  Both conform with the
highest accessibility standard for colour contrast between foreground
and background values (WCAG AAA).  I call them the "Modus themes":
_modus operandi_ is the light theme, while _modus vivendi_ is the dark
one.

The modus themes will continue to be developed until coverage of most
(if not all) faces is completed, including those defined by
third-party packages.
