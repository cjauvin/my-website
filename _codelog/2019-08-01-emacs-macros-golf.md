This video contains a concatenation of real-world simulations where I
employ keyboard macros and related commands to achieve the desired
results.  The idea is to do things efficiently, with the knowledge
that macros are an extremely powerful tool in Emacs.

The concepts implemented herein where first presented in my recent
[Introduction to keyboard macros in
Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-07-29-emacs-kbd-macros/).
