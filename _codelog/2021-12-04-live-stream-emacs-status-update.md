On Saturday 2021-12-04 at 15:00 +0300 I will do a live stream where I
will talk about the GNU Emacs packages I maintain and generally what I
have been up to over the past few weeks.  I will also answer any
questions that may appear on the live chat.  They can be related to
anything I cover on my website: <https://protesilaos.com>.

Unlike previous live streams, there will not be a presentation on some
point of intersection between Emacs and philosophy.  We will find
another opportunity to elaborate on such a topic in the near future.
