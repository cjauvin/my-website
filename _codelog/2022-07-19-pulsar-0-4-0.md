Pulsar is a small package that temporarily highlights the current line,
either on demand or automatically after invoking a function that is
present in a user-defined list.  [Watch the

-   Added the user option `pulsar-pulse-on-window-change`.  This covers
    all commands or functions that affect the current window, so there is
    no need to include them individually in the `pulsar-pulse-functions`.
    Users who prefer to trigger a pulse only after select functions
    (e.g. only after `other-window`) are advised to set this user option
    to nil and update the `pulsar-pulse-functions` accordingly.  Thanks to
    Ivan Popovych for the patch (commit `b1a78dd`).

-   Changed the default value of `pulsar-pulse-functions` to omit all
    those commands which are already covered by the aforementioned.  In
    the interest of continuity, the old value is kept in the source
    code, with the relevant symbols commented out.

-   Named the mailing list email address as the `Maintainer:` of Pulsar.
    The package headers help the user find our primary sources and/or
    communication channels.  This change conforms with work being done
    upstream in package.el by Philip Kaludercic.  I was informed about it
    here:
    <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/%3C875ykl84yi.fsf%40posteo.net%3E>.

-   Updated the documentation, where necessary and made other minor tweaks
    to the code.
