In this screen cast I offer an overview of the basic file management
operations we can perform inside of GNU Emacs.  The program that helps
us in this task is called "dired", which stands for "directory
editor".

This demo covers the basics as well as some more advanced use cases,
based on what I have learned thus far (recall that I am new to Emacs).

acompanying themes, here are the links:
