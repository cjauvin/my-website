title: "Emacs: 'ef-eagle' and 'ef-owl' are added to the 'ef-themes'"
excerpt: "I added a new light and dark theme to my 'ef-themes' package for Emacs. They use desaturated colours."

I am adding two new themes to the `ef-themes` collection. I draw
inspiration from the large birds of prey I encounter while walking
around the mountains.

Both themes are highly legible while relying on desaturated colours.

Sample pictures are available below. Check all the items here:

## Coming in version 1.8.0 (next stable release)

I consider both themes largely done, though I may still make minor
edits to them. They will be part of the next version of the
`ef-themes`, which I expect to publish toward the end of August or in
early September.

Enjoy your new themes!

The `ef-themes` are a collection of light and dark themes for GNU
Emacs that provide colourful ("pretty") yet legible options for users
who want something with a bit more flair than the `modus-themes` (also
designed by me).
