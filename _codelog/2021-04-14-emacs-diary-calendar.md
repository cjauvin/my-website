In this video I demonstrate how I use the suite of tools that is built
into Emacs for keeping track of time-sensite events in my life.  Its two
main components are the Diary and the Calendar.

Apart from the present demo, I have also written at length about this
topic and discussed my particular opinions in context.  Refer to my
Emacs configuration file ("dotemacs") for the relevant documentation and
the accompanying configurations: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs>.

The specific item that contains my extensions for both the Diary and the
Calendar is called `prot-diary.el`.  Everything is part of my dotfiles'
repository: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles>.
