title: 'Emacs: pulsar version 0.3.0'
excerpt: 'Information about the latest version of my pulsar package for GNU Emacs.'
---

Pulsar is a small package that temporarily highlights the current line,
either on demand or automatically after invoking a function that is
present in a user-defined list.  [Watch the
demo](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-03-14-emacs-pulsar-demo/) and
consult [the manual](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/pulsar) for the
technicalities.

Below are the release notes.

## Version 0.3.0 on 2022-04-08

-   Changed the source repository from GitLab to SourceHut:
    <https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/pulsar>.  Use the mailing list to
    start a discussion, report a bug, send a patch, etc.:
    <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/pulsar>.  The GitLab URL will serve
    as a mirror from now on (a GitHub mirror is still available and will
    remain that way).

-   Refined how Pulsar behaves in the case of the last line.  Basically,
    when the last line cannot be highlighted we want to pulse the one
    right above.  Thanks to JD Smith for fine-tuning this behaviour in
    merge request 1 over at the GitLab mirror:
    <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/merge_requests/1> (exempt
    from the requirement to assign copyright to the Free Software
    Foundation as it is below the threshold).

-   Ensured that the Pulsar effect are limited to the current window when
    the buffer is displayed in multiple windows.  This avoids the common
    problem of simultaneous highlights in multiple locations, which
    confuse rather than inform the user of where the point is.  Thanks to
    Aymeric Agon-Rambosson for the contribution in merge request 2 over at
    the GitLab mirror:
    <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/merge_requests/2>.  Aymeric
    has assigned copyright to the Free Software Foundation.

-   Wrote a buffer-local and a global minor mode that sets up Pulsar.
    This supersedes the old design which had a built-in assumption that
    the "pulse line" effect should always be global.  Now the user has
    more flexibility.  They may also disable Pulsar on demand.  Note that
    pulsar still only triggers its effect for entries in the user option
    `pulsar-pulse-functions`.  Thanks to Rudolf Adamkovič for the feedback
    in issue 9 over at the GitLab mirror:
    <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/9>.

-   Implement the `pulsar-highlight-dwim` command.  It is like the
    `pulsar-highlight-line` except it also understands regions, be they
    regular or rectangular.  Thanks to Mark Barton for the feedback in
    issue 13 over at the GitLab mirror:
    <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/13>.

-   Clarified some technical points in various doc strings and the manual,
    such as what is the `pulsar-delay` and the `pulsar-iterations`.
    Thanks to Rudolf Adamkovič for the feedback in issue 12 over at the
    GitLab mirror: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/12>.
