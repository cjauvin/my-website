excerpt: 'Information about the latest version of my colourful-yet-legible themes for GNU Emacs.'

The `ef-themes` is a collection of light and dark themes for GNU Emacs
whose goal is to provide colourful ("pretty") yet legible options for
users who want something with a bit more flair than the `modus-themes`
(also designed by me).

## Introduced themes for tritanopia

The `ef-tritanopia-dark` and `ef-tritanopia-light` are optimised to
use red and cyan hues consistently throughout all interfaces.  This
means that users with blue-yellow colour deficiency or blindness are
empowered to use Emacs without compromising on usability.

Read the announcement:
<https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-10-11-ef-themes-tritanopia/>.

These two themes complement what I already provide for users with
red-green colour deficiency (deuteranopia): `ef-deuteranopia-dark`,
`ef-deuteranopia-light`.  Together with the rest of the set (and my
`modus-themes`), they cover a broad spectrum of preferences and needs
for legibility.

The deuteranopia or tritanopia themes can be used by anyone, simply on
the basis of their aesthetics: they look fine and work well (when I
develop a theme, I use it full-time).

## Bespoke colours for underlines

Each theme has a new subset of colours which are optimised for
colour-coded underlines.  Think about spell checking and code linting.
These colours are specific to each theme's requirements so that, for
example, deueteranopia does not use red and green, while tritanopia
does not rely on yellow and blue.


## Support for new packages or face groups

-   corfu
-   hi-lock (`M-x highlight-regexp`)
-   flymake
-   flyspell
-   neotree


## Tweaks to already supported faces

-   The tagging operations of `notmuch` which underline added tags and
    strike through deleted ones, now use the new colours for underlines.
    The effect is small, but still constitutes an improvement.

-   The background colour of the `company` popup is a bit lighter than
    before.  This helps the foreground colours be easier to discern.  It
    also makes it look consistent with `corfu`.


## Use our communication channels

This is not a "change log" per se, but it is worth mentioning.  A few
days ago I was informed of a post on Reddit asking something related
to my themes.  Please understand that I cannot go around the Internet
hoping to provide tech support.  Each project of mine has a mailing
list and two (!) mirrors on GitHub and GitLab.  All are actively
maintained and supported.  In addition, you are always welcome to
email me directly.  I reply in a timely fashion and in full (check the
mailing lists and issue trackers, if you have any doubt).  What I will
not do is go searching for you on random websites.
