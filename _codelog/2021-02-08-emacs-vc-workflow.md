In this video I provide an overview of my workflow with the built-in
Version Control (VC) framework of Emacs.  I am using it to manage all of
my Git projects.  VC has become my primary interface for Git even though
I keep Magit installed.  The latter is only needed for some specialised
operations---VC and my extras cover my day-to-day needs.

This demo includes lots of custom extensions that I have written in an
attempt to make VC work the way I want.  Refer to my Emacs configuration
file ("dotemacs") for the implementation details:
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs>.  The specific item that contains
those extensions is `prot-vc.el`.  Everything is part of my dotfiles'
repository: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles>.
