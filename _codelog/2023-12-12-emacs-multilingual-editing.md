In this ~10 minute video I show how to use Emacs to edit text in
multiple languages. This is better than using the system-level
keyboard layout configuration because you retain all the functionality
of Emacs for key bindings (e.g. `C-n`, `C-p`, `M-x`). In the video I
demonstrate the various input methods, with prefix or postfix
notation, and character composition.
