title: 'Emacs: fontaine version 0.4.0'
excerpt: 'Information about the latest version of my fontaine package for GNU Emacs.'
---

Fontaine lets the user specify presets of font configurations and switch
between them on demand.  This makes it easy to optimise for different
contexts, such as a "reading" preset with large, spacious fonts, and an
"editing" preset with smaller, more compact fonts.

-   Made it possible for the user option `fontaine-presets` to cover the
    `fixed-pitch-serif` face.  This face is used by the default Emacs
    faces in Info buffers to render inline code elements.  A list of
    properties within `fontaine-presets` can thus look like this (the
    manual explains everything in detail&#x2014;else check my current setup at
    the end of this entry):

    ```elisp
    (regular
     ;; I keep all properties for didactic purposes, but most can be
     ;; omitted.
     :default-family "Monospace"
     :default-weight regular
     :default-height 100
     :fixed-pitch-family nil ; falls back to :default-family
     :fixed-pitch-weight nil ; falls back to :default-weight
     :fixed-pitch-height 1.0
     :fixed-pitch-serif-family nil ; falls back to :default-family
     :fixed-pitch-serif-weight nil ; falls back to :default-weight
     :fixed-pitch-serif-height 1.0
     :variable-pitch-family "Sans"
     :variable-pitch-weight nil
     :variable-pitch-height 1.0
     :bold-family nil ; use whatever the underlying face has
     :bold-weight bold
     :italic-family nil
     :italic-slant italic
     :line-spacing nil)
    ```

    When the relevant attributes of `fixed-pitch-serif` are not specified,
    they fall back to the values of the `default` face.

    Note that `fixed-pitch-serif` is not used by my `modus-themes` and
    `ef-themes` because I think it looks awful out-of-the-box (a bitmap
    font on the GNU/Linux distros I used).  One can still modify any face
    to inherit from `fixed-pitch-serif`, if they want to.

-   Introduced the command `fontaine-apply-current-preset` and wrote a
    relevant entry in the manual on how to "Persist font configurations on
    theme switch".  Relevant quote from the manual:

    > Themes re-apply face definitions when they are loaded.  This is
    > necessary to render the theme.  For certain faces, such as `bold` and
    > `italic`, it means that their font family may be reset (depending on the
    > particularities of the theme).
    >
    > To avoid such a problem, we can arrange to restore the current font
    > preset which was applied by `fontaine-set-preset`.  Fontaine provides
    > the command `fontaine-apply-current-preset`.  It can either be called
    > interactively after loading a theme or be assigned to a hook that is ran
    > at the post `load-theme` phase.
    >
    > Some themes that provide a hook are the `modus-themes` and `ef-themes`
    > (both by Protesilaos), so we can use something like: [&#x2026;]

-   The once private variable `fontaine--current-preset` is now made
    public by means of a rename to `fontaine-current-preset`.  In
    practical terms, this tells advanced users that they can rely on the
    presence of this variable and/or on the fact that changes to it will
    be documented accordingly.

My current configuration as of 2022-09-07 17:56 +0300, which might give
you some ideas:
