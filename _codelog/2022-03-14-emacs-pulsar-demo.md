In this video I introduce and demonstrate my new `pulsar` package.
Pulsar temporarily highlights the current line.  It can do so either on
demand or automatically after another user-defined function is
invoked.

There are options which define (i) which functions should automatically
pulse the line, (ii) what colour the highlight should use, (iii) how
long the effect shall last.  The manual provides sample configuration
and also explains how `pulsar` can integrate with other packages:
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/pulsar>.

The plan is to add this to GNU ELPA.  Please check `M-x list-packages`
in the comings hours/days.
