This is the video presentation of `hyperdrive.el` that we prepared for
EmacsConf 2023 together with Joseph Turner:
<https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/hyperdrive/>. The `hyperdrive.el`
package provides an Emacs interface to the hyperdrive peer-to-peer
filesystem.

- Joseph introduces the concept of hyperdrive and describes what their
  work is about.

- Then I take the stage to present the user-facing basics of managing
  hyper drives in Emacs with `hyperdrive.el`. I show how to use the
  menu, upload a file, navigate the Dired-like buffer of the drive,
  edit files, and also talk about how versioning works with
  hyperdrive.

- Finally, I give the stage back to Joseph to further elaborate on the
  concepts of `hyperdrive.el`, including how we can name the drives of
  other people and use the mirroring functionality to upload lots of
  files at once.

I use `hyperdrive.el` to share pictures and video clips that typically
do not get published on my website, either due bandwidth
considerations or because they are small and do not fit into any of
the categories I have (e.g. a ~1 minute clip of an eagle flying above
my hut). The potential of peer-to-peer technology intrigues me. We can
collaborate with others and share files between us without being
dependent on centralised nodes/actors/providers. Here is the link to
my drive:

## About Joseph Turner

I'm Joseph Turner. I enjoy fiddle, Aikido, peer-to-peer networks,
Emacs, and swimming in cold water. I work with USHIN, a tiny
educational US nonprofit whose mission is to promote personal,
community, and global health through free and open universal shared

hyperdrive.el project, with the goal of bringing Emacs and
peer-to-peer together.
