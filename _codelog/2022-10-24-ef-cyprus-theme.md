title: "Emacs: introduction to the ef-themes “cyprus” theme"
excerpt: "I added another theme to my 'ef-themes' collection.  It is a legible light theme with green, yellow, teal, red colors."
---

I just added `ef-cyprus` to my `ef-themes` package.  This brings the
total count to 19 items, spanning a wide range of stylistic
preferences as well as technical requirements (e.g. deuteranopia,
tritanopia).  `ef-cyprus` is another legible light theme with warm
colours, predominantly shades of green, yellow, teal, and red.  The
name is a reference to the country I currently reside in, whose
landscapes and clear skies have served as an inspiration.

Some screen shots are provided below, though you can find pictures of
all the items in the collection here:

[ The `ef-themes` are a collection of light and dark themes for GNU
  Emacs whose goal is to provide colourful ("pretty") yet legible
  options for users who want something with a bit more flair than the
  `modus-themes` (also designed by me). ]

## Coming in version 0.9.0 (next stable release)

`ef-cyprus` is in development.  I have been using it for several days
now and think it is in a very good state.  I might still make some
changes to it, though its character is already well-defined.

Expect the next version in the coming days.  I still have some other
tasks to do before it is ready.
