title: "My forthcoming Emacs and philosophy talk at LibrePlanet 2022"
excerpt: "Announcement about my presentation at LibrePlanet 2022 (the annual conference organised by the Free Software Foundation)."
---

LibrePlanet is an annual conference organised by the Free Software
Foundation.  The program for this year's edition has been published:
<https://libreplanet.org/2022/program/>.  The event takes place between
March 19-20, 2022.  Judging from past conferences, all videos will be
recorded.

I will talk for 35 minutes about Emacs and freedom in general.  There
will then be 10 minutes during which I will try to answer any comments
from the audience.  Here is the excerpt for my presentation:

> An overview of how GNU Emacs allows us to live in freedom both in
> moral and practical terms, as seen from the perspective of a
> non-programmer. Specific use cases are generalized into philosophical
> insights such as the ethos of sharing know-how and the community
> aspect of freedom.

And my bio:

> Protesilaos (aka "Prot") is a philosopher with a background in the
> humanities.  He used to work in politics, including as a parliamentary
> assistant at the European Parliament.  He switched to free software in
> 2016 on the premise that it empowered the end user to operate the
> computer on their own terms.  Since 2019, he is a power user of GNU
> Emacs.  Prot is the author/maintainer of the modus-themes project: a
> pair of highly accessible themes which are built into Emacs.  Prot is
> a tinkerer who has learnt how to program by using the free/libre tools
> at his disposal.

  not find one to borrow... ]

"See you" there!
