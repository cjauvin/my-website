In this screen cast I talk about the main idea of switching to Emacs
and how it shares the same objective as that of the terminal/CLI power
user: to develop a consistent, integrated computing environment.

Couched in those terms, I claim that the Unix philosophy of "do one
thing and do it well" is not an obstacle to using Emacs.  The Emacs
mindset of an integrated workflow and the Unix design principles are
not mutually exclusive.
