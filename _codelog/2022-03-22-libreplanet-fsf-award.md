On 2022-03-19 the Free Software Foundation awarded me the _2021 Award
for Outstanding New Free Software Contributor_.  The award ceremony took
place in the context of this year's LibrePlanet conference, where this
video message of mine was shown.

What I said:

> Hello everyone!  My name is Protesilaos.  Some friends call me "Prot"
> and you are welcome to do the same.
>
> I wish to thank the Free Software Foundation for this award.  I was
> not expecting it, just as I was not expecting to make any kind of
> contribution to GNU Emacs, given my non-technical background.
>
> As I also say in my presentation for LibrePlanet 2022 my background
> was not tech-related: it was in the humanities and I eventually learnt
> to program by tinkering with Emacs and all the free software resources
> that were given to me.
>
> So while this award is given to an individual, I think it actually is
> all about the community.  How the community---how all those unsung
> heroes---have helped a given person achieve certain things.  And this
> is because when I came to Emacs, when I switched to Emacs, when I
> joined this milieu two-and-a-half years ago I discovered everything I
> needed.  There was high quality documentation, an excellent program in
> the face of GNU Emacs, lots of blogs and tutorials and everything and,
> of course, interactions with different people from where you always
> get to learn something new.
>
> So I wish to thank everyone from this broader community for all their
> efforts and all their contributions.  Without them I wouldn't be
> anywhere and I think it's fair to say that without the unsung heroes
> in our life in general, no individual would achieve anything of
> significance.
>
> I wish to thank, in particular, some people who have been very helpful
> in my time as an Emacs user; who have helped me learn things.  And
> those are, in no particular order: Daniel Mendler, Manuel Uberti,
> Nicolas De Jaeghere, and Omar AntolÃ­n Camarena.  So I wish to thank
> those and, of course, everyone else.  Thanks to the FSF for this
> award!
