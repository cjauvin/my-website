**The video will be recorded and can be watched later.**  I will do
some work on my Denote package and maybe tackle other Emacs-related
issues.  I plan to make this about 2 hours long, though we will see in
practice.

## About Denote

Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the
idea that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive
file-naming scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of
what the note is about, without reference to any other metadata.
Denote basically streamlines the creation of such files while
providing facilities to link between them.

Denote's file-naming scheme is not limited to "notes".  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.
