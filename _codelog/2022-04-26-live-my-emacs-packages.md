On Tuesday 2022-04-26 at 14:00 +0300 I will hold a live stream.  The
main topic will be an overview of [my packages for
Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/emacs).  I will also briefly talk about
my other publications.  Then I shall join the chat to comment on any
remarks or comments made by the audience.

The text of the introductory presentation will be available here shortly
before I go live.
