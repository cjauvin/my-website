In this screen cast I demonstrate how to use `magit`, the _superb_ git
porcelain for Emacs, to interactively re-base your commits before
pushing them to the remote repository.  This is a good way of rewriting
your local branch's history, so as to keep things clean and make them
easier to understand.

Also check my other short video on the same principle: [git commit fixup
with
Magit](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-11-27-emacs-magit-commit-fixup/).
