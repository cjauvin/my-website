title: "The colours of the Emacs modus-themes are in the public domain"
excerpt: "A new page on my website dedicates to the public domain the colours---just the colours---of my modus-themes for Emacs."

On the mailing list of the `modus-themes`, user "takeda" inquired
whether they could use [colours from my themes to style their
website](https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/modus-themes/%3Cab5aecd7-6def-42ff-87ca-800f303e3749%40www.fastmail.com%3E).
There was uncertainty about the matter, as the themes are distributed
under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 (or later)
and takeda has a website whose source code is closed: it would
constitute a violation of the GPL to re-use copylefted code in a
non-copyleft code base, or so the thinking was.

After [consulting with the folks on the emacs-devel mailing
list](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-05/msg00152.html),
I am putting the colour palette of the `modus-themes`---just the ~400
colours, not the entire source code---in the public domain (technically,
the Creative Commons Zero license (CC0)).  Thanks to everyone involved!

The reason I asked about this on emacs-devel is because the
`modus-themes` (`modus-operandi` and `modus-vivendi`) are built into
Emacs (since August 2020) and I did not want to jeopardise Emacs or
anyhow put the maintainers in a difficult spot.

To copy the colours freely, visit:
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes-colors>.  **You do not have
to provide attribution for the colour palette**, but doing so, such as
by linking to that page, can help others discover the original material.

That granted, I must stress that _the Modus themes are not colour
schemes and cannot be thus reduced_.  They are fully fledged
applications: colours in certain combinations which are applied to
particular contexts using specific methods.  In simple terms, I pick
colours that work well for the purposes of the design and concomitant
accessibility standards, but I do not, say, choose a shade of yellow
that has the prettiest contrast next to a shade of blue---what a colour
scheme does.  If I were to design a colour scheme, I would make
different decisions.
