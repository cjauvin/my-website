In this ~25 minute video, I present my new Emacs configuration. It is
an advanced setup that starts with a literate Org program as the
"source of truth". This file generates all the individual modules and
custom libraries of my setup. I explain all the technicalities and why
this approach is the best of both worlds to (i) document the rich
corpus of work found in my dotfiles while (ii) not compromising on
code excellence.
