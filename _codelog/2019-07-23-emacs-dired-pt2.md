This screen cast covers some more features of Emacs' built-in file
manager, called "Dired" (directory editor).  It builds on the
knowledge I shared in yesterday's entry about the [basics of Emacs
dired](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-07-22-emacs-dired-basics/).

In case you are interested to have a look at my configurations and
accompanying themes, here are the links:
