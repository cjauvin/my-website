In this video I showcase my new `logos.el` package.  I will release
version `0.1.0` later today and then submit it to GNU ELPA.

Quote from the manual:

> This package provides a simple "focus mode" which can be applied to
> any buffer for reading, writing, or even doing a presentation.  The
> buffer can be divided in pages using the `page-delimiter`, outline
> structure, or any other pattern.  Commands are provided to move
> between those pages.  These motions work even when narrowing is in
> effect (and they preserve it).  `logos.el` is designed to be simple by
> default and easy to extend.  This manual provides concrete examples to
> that end.

I have already made several presentations using this package and am
happy with the results.

**UPDATE 2022-03-12 05:36 +0200:** The package is available from GNU
ELPA as `logos`.
