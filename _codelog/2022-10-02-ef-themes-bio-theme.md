I just added `ef-bio` to my `ef-themes` collection.  It is a legible
dark theme with green, teal, blue, purple colors.

[ The `ef-themes` are a collection of light and dark themes for GNU
  Emacs whose goal is to provide colourful ("pretty") yet legible
  options for users who want something with a bit more flair than the
  `modus-themes` (also designed by me). ]

Some screen shots are provided below, though also check all the themes
here: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes-pictures>.

## Coming in version 0.7.0 (next stable release)

The `ef-bio` theme is in development.  It will probably not change
much, though I might make some further tweaks to it.  Expect this and
other updates to be widely available via GNU ELPA some time in mid
October.
