In this video I demonstrate how I combine Elfeed and Bongo into a
workflow for storing and playing content from my multimedia feeds
(podcasts and videos).  The implementation is fairly straightforward and
the overall result is quite effective, based on my expectations.

On a more general note, this shows yet again how integration between
various otherwise standalone tools is one of Emacs' greatest strengths.

To understand how I use Elfeed and Bongo separately, you can watch my
recent videos:
