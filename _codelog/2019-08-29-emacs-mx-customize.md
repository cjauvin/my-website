In this screen cast I showcase the main uses of Emacs' built-in
customisation interface.  This can be used to configure the various
aspects of Emacs.  You can also use it as a browser for finding new
things that you would eventually like to add to your own
initialisation file.

What I demonstrated in this video works with the default Emacs
distribution.  Here is my own init file, if you are interested:
