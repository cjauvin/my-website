In this video I offer an introduction to `rg.el`, an interface to the
`ripgrep` command line tool.  I like this package because it remains
faithful to the interface paradigms that are implemented by similar
tools inside of Emacs, such as the built-in `grep` or `occur`.  I also
appreciate the fact that it interfaces with `ibuffer`, another built-in
library.

Check [my dotemacs](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs) for configurations
on `rg.el` and more.
