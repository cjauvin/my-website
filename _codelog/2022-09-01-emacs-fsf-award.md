In this video I show the award that the FSF gave me.  It arrived in my
mail a few days ago.

## Backstory

In March 2022 the Free Software Foundation gave me the "2021 Award for
Outstanding New Free Software Contributor".  This was done in the
context of the LibrePlanet 2022 conference, where I also delivered a
speech.  I was asked to record a brief clip for the awards' ceremony,
which I did: [I won an award from the FSF for my contributions to
Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-03-22-libreplanet-fsf-award/)

Excerpt of what I originally said:

> So while this award is given to an individual, I think it actually is
> all about the community.  How the community---how all those unsung
> heroes---have helped a given person achieve certain things.  And this
> is because when I came to Emacs, when I switched to Emacs, when I
> joined this milieu two-and-a-half years ago I discovered everything I
> needed.  There was high quality documentation, an excellent program in
> the face of GNU Emacs, lots of blogs and tutorials and everything and,
> of course, interactions with different people from where you always
> get to learn something new.

## Special thanks

As I said in my original message, I would not have done anything if
there was no community around Emacs.  I learnt a lot from the
contributions of other people and also benefited from their insights.  I
thanked all the "unsung heroes" and I wish to do so again.

Special thanks, once more, to the individuals who helped me either
directly or indirectly in my first steps:

- **Daniel Mendler:** The most enduring lesson I have learnt from Daniel
  is how to keep a package's scope focused and how to be principled
  about it.  Daniel has lots of useful packages for Emacs, all of which
  are of a high standard.

- **Manuel Uberti:** Manuel helped me in the early days of the
  `modus-themes` development understand what packages are available out
  there and how people use them.

- **Nicolas de Jaeghere:** Nicholas helped me understand Emacs Lisp
  macros better.  This was critical for version `1.0.0` of the
  `modus-themes` and has proven useful ever since.

- **Omar Antol√≠n Camarena:** Omar also helped me with macros and lots of
  other concepts that pertain to coding in Elisp.  Those insights helped
  me tinker with my configuration and continue learning through trial
  and error.
