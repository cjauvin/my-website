I will work on some of my packages for Emacs. The idea is to spend ~2
hours maintaining `fontaine`, `spacious-padding`, `denote`, `ef-themes`,
and maybe others.

This being a live stream, I will accept any questions in the comments
section and may thus talk about issues not related to the topic of
maintaining the aforementioned packages.

**The video will be recorded and can be watched later.**

All my Emacs-related work: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs>.
