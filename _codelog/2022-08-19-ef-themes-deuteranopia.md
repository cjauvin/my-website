title: "The ef-themes now include two deuteranopia-friendly themes"
excerpt: "I added a light and a dark theme to the 'ef-themes' which are optimised for users with red-green colour deficiency"

[ For an introduction and comprehensive video tour of the ef-themes:

I have been working non-stop since last night to add two themes to my
new `ef-themes` project for GNU Emacs.  Those are the
`ef-deuteranopia-light` and `ef-deuteranopia-dark`.  Both are designed
to accommodate the needs of users with red-green colour
deficiency/blindness (deuteranopia).  In simple terms, those themes only
use shades of blue and yellow for their accents.  Expect to find
consistent blue-yellow colour combinations throughout the themes.

I expect that users will appreciate the accessibility these offer,
beside whatever aesthetic considerations.

These will be part of the next tagged release.  Expect it some time next
week, together with other useful changes/additions.
