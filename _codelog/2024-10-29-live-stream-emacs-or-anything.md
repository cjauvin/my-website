I will do a live stream this Thursday. The idea is to answer any
question from those who join the stream. The topics can be about
anything, from Emacs to philosophy, to life in general.

If there are no questions, then I will do some maintenance of my Emacs
packages (not sure which ones, but there is always something).

Depending on how things go, the event will be around two hours long. I
am happy to run it for longer (four hours maximum because then the sun
sets and I have to switch off the computer).

The event will be recorded. No worries if you cannot make it.
