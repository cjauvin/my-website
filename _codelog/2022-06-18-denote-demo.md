Denote is a new package that I am developing for Emacs.  Its first
stable release will be avaible in the coming days from the official GNU
ELPA.

Denote is the culmination of methods and code I have been relying for
several years now (including from my pre-Emacs days).

Here is the official manual which includes links to the Git sources and
the mailing list: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote>.

And here is the page that outlines all my Emacs-related public work:
