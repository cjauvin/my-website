No work at home, no work for hut project, so I am doing a live stream
about my `denote` package.  I want to get into unit testing with the
`ert` package that is built into Emacs.  **The video will be recorded
and can be watched later.**

I have never written unit tests before.  I want to learn them as a
general skill, but also because I want `denote` to have comprehensive
tests in place before its next major release.

I understand I am announcing this without much prior notice (current
time 13:02 +0300).  No worries!

## About Denote

Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the
idea that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive
file-naming scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of
what the note is about, without reference to any other metadata.
Denote basically streamlines the creation of such files while
providing facilities to link between them.

Denote's file-naming scheme is not limited to "notes".  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a constistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.
