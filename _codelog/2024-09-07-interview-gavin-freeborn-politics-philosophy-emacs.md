In this ~1-hour video I talk with Gavin about all sorts of interesting
topics:

- how I got into Emacs and what I do with it
- the Vim paradigm and structural editing
- programming and writing prose have different requirements
- living in a city and then going to the mountains
- how taking a step back can help you be in control
- physical activity, hikes, and the like
- what kind of philosophy I do
- whether people should study philosophy
- if I am drawn to the academic philosophical discourse and what I
  think about it
- whether we should have an interest in politics
- how I see politics and why I focus on common sense
- if I could change society, what I would try to do
- how we take freedoms for granted and why this can be a mistake
- the idea of small communities organising their collective life

Thanks to Gavin for this interview! I had a good time and learnt new
things in the process. I hope you will enjoy it as well.
