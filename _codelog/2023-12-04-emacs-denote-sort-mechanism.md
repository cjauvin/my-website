In this ~13 minute video I demonstrate the new functionality I am
developing for Denote. It allows us to produce sorted lists of files
based on any of the file name components that Denote formalises. The
command 'denote-sort-dired' leverages this facility, as do the Org
dynamic blocks that Denote defines.

## About Denote

Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the idea
that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming
scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is
about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically
streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to
link between them.

Denote's file-naming scheme is not limited to "notes".  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.
