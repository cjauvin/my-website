a legible light theme with blue, red, magenta, and earthly colours.

## Coming in version 1.0.0 (next stable release)

`ef-kassio` is under development.  It is largely done, though I may
still tweak some details.

The Ef themes now consist of 22 themes, 11 light and 11 dark ones.
The new version will also include commands to select between either
set and will also provide completion annotations that describe each
theme.

The `ef-themes` are a collection of light and dark themes for GNU Emacs
whose goal is to provide colorful ("pretty") yet legible options for
users who want something with a bit more flair than the `modus-themes`
(also designed by me).
