title: "Emacs: I am co-presenting hyperdrive.el at EmacsConf 2023"
excerpt: "I will be at EmacsConf 2023 to talk about hypedrive.el: a new package for a peer-to-peer filesystem in Emacs."

I am participating at this year's EmacsConf. The event takes place
this weekend: <https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/>.

My talk is about `hyperdrive.el`, a peer-to-peer filesystem in Emacs.
I am co-presenting it with Joseph Turner. More information here:
<https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/hyperdrive/>.

Make sure to tune in for the conference. All the presentations are
interesting and it is nice for us to come together as a community.

The hyperdrive video plays during my evening local time. I am
available to join live, though I do not know yet if my electricity
setup will have enough power left by then (usually I am without power
after ~20:30). It depends on the weather. If all goes well, I will be
there.

Good luck to everyone involved!
