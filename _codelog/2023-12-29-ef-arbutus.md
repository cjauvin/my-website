title: "Emacs: 'ef-arbutus' is now part of the 'ef-themes' collection"
excerpt: "I added a new pair of dark and light themes to my 'ef-themes' collection.  They are quite different from the rest of the collection."
---

`ef-arbutus` is a legible light theme that blends shades of red and
green. I drew inspiration from the beautiful Greek strawberry trees
(_arbutus andrachne_) I encounter in my mountains, which are evergreen
and have a deep red bark.

In terms of the overall look and feel, `ef-arbutus` has a fairly
pronounced background colour. This puts it in the same subset as the
"elea", "maris", and "melissa" variants. Unlike them, though, it has
no dark counterpart.

Sample pictures are shown below, though make sure to review the entire
collection: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes-pictures>.

## Coming in version 1.5.0 (next stable release)

I may still make some minor tweaks, though the character of the theme
will not be altered.

`ef-arbutus` is the 29th item in the collection. Will there be a 30th
and will it be a dark theme? Who knows?

The `ef-themes` are a collection of light and dark themes for GNU Emacs
whose goal is to provide colorful ("pretty") yet legible options for
users who want something with a bit more flair than the `modus-themes`
(also designed by me).
