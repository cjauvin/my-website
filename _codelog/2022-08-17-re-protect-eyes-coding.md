I think you are asking for a software solution to a hardware and
ergonomics problem.  If you are coding all day, then you do not give
your eyes the chance to replenish their energy.  The eye is no different
than the rest of the body in its need for rest: push it all day and it
tires out; do so over an extended period of time and it wears out.

No theme---no single piece of software---will adequately fix a
hardware/ergonomics problem.  Sure, my themes are designed to be
legible, but they cannot prevent you from harming yourself by making
inconsiderate life choices.  It is you who has to impose structure in your
routines.  "Structure" here entails taking breaks and paying attention
to the needs of the body: you are not a machine.

Please don't take me wrong.  I also get absorbed in engrossing
experiences and may write/code for hours on end.  But I do take long
breaks and do venture outdoors where light and shadow are generally more
balanced than in a room.

I strongly encourage you to consider the following non-exhaustive list
of items:

* Always---always!---have an extra source of light in the room, beside
  that of the monitor.  Without peripheral light, the eyes focus on the
  single source they can discern, which tires them out.

* Check that the room has plenty of light.  Try to have warm lights
  available at night.  If possible, let natural light into the room.

* Calibrate your monitor's settings to keep sharpness at reasonable
  levels.  I have noticed many monitors which crank sharpness to the
  maximum value because that is supposed to give more crisp text.  It
  doesn't.  It is just a gimmick that makes you dizzy after prolonged
  exposure to text.  Max sharpness is a cheap trick to obfuscate the
  monitor's actual capabilities.  Better apply a moderate value and then
  consider your typography+theme choices.

* High contrast themes are great for monitors with limited capabilities.
  Perhaps the most common remark I get is something like "the
  `modus-themes` have effectively upgraded my monitor".

* Do not make compromises on typography.  Apply the best fonts you can
  get.  For example, if you are using a bitmap font against a light
  background, you are asking for trouble: it is terrible (ceteris
  paribus)!  Many fonts are not good enough at several point sizes.
  Their glyphs produce a halo effect which makes them look blurry.  When
  picking a font, first test its working ability and then evaluate its
  looks.  Pretty-yet-unusable is a bad choice (in my opinion that is not
  "pretty", but I digress).

* Adjust your monitor's brightness based on the levels of environmental
  light.  If you are in a very dark room, lower the brightness so that
  you are not beaming a strong source of light directly into your eyes.
  Conversely, set it to its maximum value (or thereabouts) when you are
  outdoors on a sunny day.  Again, when you are in a room remember the
  point of having additional sources of light.

* Use a theme depending on the available light.  Prefer light themes
  during the day (given sunshine) or while you are in a well-lit room.
  In darker environments, opt for a dark theme, without prejudice to all
  of the aforementioned.

* Take breaks!  Did I mention the importance of rest?  Take breaks!
  Whatever you do in exaggeration, you do it to your detriment.

With those granted, my answer to your question about customisation
options is that those are a matter of preference.

Apply the same mindset to all hardware/ergonomics issues.  Be prepared
for thoroughgoing reforms in your setup and routines.  Software alone
cannot fix that which is caused by your lifestyle and/or office/work
setup.
