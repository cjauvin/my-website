In this video I talk about the basics of developing in Clojure with
Emacs.  I provide an overview of `clojure-mode` and the powerful
interactive environment of `cider`.

As I mentioned in a recent announcement, I am learning Clojure in an
attempt to acquire new skills that I need for my job search.  My hope
is that it will improve my chances.
