title: 'Emacs: fontaine version 0.3.0'
excerpt: 'Information about the latest version of my fontaine package for GNU Emacs.'
---

Fontaine lets the user specify presets of font configurations and switch
between them on demand.  This makes it easy to optimise for different
contexts, such as a "reading" preset with large, spacious fonts, and an
"editing" preset with smaller, more compact fonts.

This is a stability release that introduces minor tweaks while
formalising point releases which were already available to users.

-   Fixed a bug where a nil minibuffer history would produce an error
    while trying to set a preset.

-   Required the `subr-x` library at compile time.  This is to avoid
    scenaria where `if-let` and friends are not known to the byte
    compiler.  Such a problem was reported by Ted Reed concerning their
    Emacs 27 build:
    <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/fontaine/%3Cm27d6t3f7a.fsf@zenithia.net%3E#%3C87ee11w1j0.fsf@zenithia.net%3E>.

-   Simplified the text of the minibuffer prompt for the `default` face.
    The `marginalia` package treats the candidates as faces when the word
    "face" occurs in the prompt.  Generally that should be okay, though we
    do not want it in our case.

-   Documented a reference to the "devel" variant of GNU ELPA.  This is
    for users who want to use a version of the package built from the
    latest commit instead of the last tagged release.  Read:
    <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-05-13-emacs-elpa-devel/>.

-   Refrained from erroring out with `fontaine-set-preset` if Emacs is not
    in a graphical window (GUI) while the `emacs --daemon` is in use.  The
    `user-error` is now limited to the case where a standalone frame is
    non-graphial and the daemon is not running (the error is that you
    cannot change fonts inside of TUI Emacs).  Thanks to Florent Teissier
    for the patch!

-   Named the mailing list address as the `Maintainer:` of Denote.
    Together with the other package headers, they help the user find our
    primary sources and/or communication channels.  This change conforms
    with work being done upstream in package.el by Philip Kaludercic.  I
    was informed about it here:
    <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/%3C875ykl84yi.fsf%40posteo.net%3E>.
