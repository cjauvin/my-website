title: "Emacs: cursory version 1.0.0"
excerpt: 'Information about the latest version of my Cursory package for GNU Emacs.'

Cursory provides a thin wrapper around built-in variables that affect
the style of the Emacs cursor on graphical terminals.  The intent is
to allow the user to define preset configurations such as "block with
slow blinking" or "bar with fast blinking" and set them on demand.
The use-case for such presets is to adapt to evolving interface
requirements and concomitant levels of expected comfort, such as in
the difference between writing and reading.

* * *

Cursory has been in a stable state for a long time.  I use it daily
and am happy with what it does.  This version refactors parts of the
code in the interest of legibility/hackability, while providing a
quality-of-life feature for users.


## A preset can now inherit from another

In the interest of defining multiple presets while avoiding
duplication, the user option `cursory-presets` now accepts an
`:inherit` property.  For example:

```elisp
(setq cursory-presets
      '(
        ;; Sample code here ...

        (bar
         :cursor-type (bar . 2)
         :cursor-in-non-selected-windows hollow
         :blink-cursor-mode 1
         :blink-cursor-blinks 10
         :blink-cursor-interval 0.5
         :blink-cursor-delay 0.2)

        (bar-no-other-window
         :inherit bar
         :cursor-in-non-selected-windows nil)

        ;; More sample code here ...
        ))
```

Presets were already capable of getting properties from a default `t`
preset.  Now they can be controlled with greater precision.

The value of `cursory-presets` is updated accordingly to benefit from
this mechanism and to showcase how it is done:

```elisp
(defcustom cursory-presets
  '((box
     :blink-cursor-interval 0.8)
    (box-no-blink
     :blink-cursor-mode -1)
    (bar
     :cursor-type (bar . 2)
     :blink-cursor-interval 0.5)
    (bar-no-other-window
     :inherit bar
     :cursor-in-non-selected-windows nil)
    (underscore
     :cursor-type (hbar . 3)
     :blink-cursor-blinks 50)
    (underscore-thin-other-window
     :inherit underscore
     :cursor-in-non-selected-windows (hbar . 1))
    (t ; the default values
     :cursor-type box
     :cursor-in-non-selected-windows hollow
     :blink-cursor-mode 1
     :blink-cursor-blinks 10
     :blink-cursor-interval 0.2
     :blink-cursor-delay 0.2))
  ;; Omitting the doc string for demo purposes...
  )
```

In the above sample, we notice both the `:inherit` property and the
default `t` preset with all its properties.  Presets beside `t` act as
overrides of the defaults and, as such, need only consist of the
properties that change from the default.  In the case of an
`:inherit`, properties are first taken from the inherited preset and
then the default one.
