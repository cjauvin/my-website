title: "Emacs: introduction to the ef-themes “cherie” theme"
excerpt: "I added another theme to my 'ef-themes' collection.  It is a legible dark theme with warm colors (mostly pink, magenta, gold)."
---

The `ef-cherie` theme is now part of my `ef-themes` package.  It is a
legible dark theme with warm colors (mostly pink, magenta, gold).
Conceptually, it is the _first_ theme I designed for this project but
never finalised: it was missing the _je ne sais quoi_ that only became
obvious after I started covering the different stylistic variants that
form part of this collection.

Sample pictures are shown below.  Also check the entire set:
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes-pictures>.  To get the most
accurate results, **click to enlarge the image**.

The `ef-themes` now includes 20 items (10 light, 10 dark), which cover
a broad range of preferences and requirements for accessibility.  I
consider the project complete from a stylistic point of view,
potential tweaks notwithstanding.

[ The `ef-themes` are a collection of light and dark themes for GNU
  Emacs whose goal is to provide colourful ("pretty") yet legible
  options for users who want something with a bit more flair than the
  `modus-themes` (also designed by me). ]

## Comparison between ef-trio-dark, ef-cherie, ef-winter

These share some similarities, though you will notice that the new
theme is much warmer than the other two.  The following samples show
`ef-trio-dark`, `ef-cherie`, `ef-winter` in this order.

## Coming in version 0.9.0 (next stable release)

`ef-cherie` is under development.  I think its character is clear at
this point and will condition any possible tweaks to its colour
palette or how colours are mapped to various constructs.  At any rate,
changes are still possible.

Expect this and other goodies to be widely available in the next
version of the `ef-themes`, which I will prepare some time before the
end of this month.
