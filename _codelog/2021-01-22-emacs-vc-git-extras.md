In this video I demonstrate some of the commands I have for working with
the built-in version control (VC) framework and, specifically, its Git
back-end.  Those offer a layer of interactivity on top of the `git`
program you normally get on the command line, while the make various VC
interfaces easier to use.

Refer to my Emacs configuration file ("dotemacs") for the implementation
details: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs>.  The specific item that
contains those extensions is `prot-vc.el`.  Everything is part of my
dotfiles' repository: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles>.
