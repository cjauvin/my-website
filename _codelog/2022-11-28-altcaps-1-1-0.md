## New user option

Introduced the user option `altcaps-force-character-casing`.  It
forces the given letter casing for specified characters.  Its value is
an alist of `(CHARACTER . CASE)` pairs.  `CHARACTER` is a single
character (satisfies the `characterp` condition), while `CASE` is the
`upcase` or `downcase` symbol (code sample further below).

The idea is to always render certain characters in lower or upper
case, in consideration of their legibility in context.  For example,
the default altcaps algorithm produces this:

    iLlIcIt IlLiBeRaL sIlLiNeSs

Whereas if the value of this variable declares `i` to always be
lowercase and `L` uppercase, then we get this:

    iLLiCiT iLLiBeRaL siLLiNeSs

The code to do this:

```elisp
(setq altcaps-force-character-casing
      '((?i . downcase)
        (?l . upcase)))
```

Thanks to Cédric Barreteau for the idea of forcing a given letter case
on specified characters.  I think that giving users the option keeps
our code simple, while providing a useful point of customisation.

Cédric is the author of the nvim-altcaps, which is a plugin for NeoVim
based on my `altcaps` idea: <https://github.com/cbarrete/nvim-altcaps>.


## Improvements to documentation

-   Wrote a `README.md` which contains basic information about the
    project, including links to the official Git repos, its mirrors on
    GitHub/GitLab, as well as the project's mailing list.  This file is
    useful for Git forges that have trouble parsing an Org file (the
    manual is `README.org`, which the GNU ELPA machinery converts into a
    proper Info manual).
-   Added missing index entries to the manual for our commands and the
    new user option.
-   Wrote this very `CHANGELOG.org`, which is helpful for those who
    inspect the Git repository.
