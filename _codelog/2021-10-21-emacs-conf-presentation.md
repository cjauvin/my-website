title: "My talk at EmacsConf 2021 and its backstory"
excerpt: "Announcement about my presentation at the annual Emacs conference that will take place on November 27-28, 2021."

This year's Emacs conference (EmacsConf 2021) will take place on
November 27 and 28.  I will be among the speakers.  My talk's
description:

> How Emacs made me appreciate software freedom
> 
> The theme will be "how Emacs empowered my software freedom".  I will
> outline the key moments in my transition to a GNU/Linux operating
> system and mark those which eventually contributed towards me becoming
> an Emacs user, maintainer of a---dare I say---popular package, and
> contributor to upstream Emacs (among others).  By alluding to personal
> experiences, I will draw generalisable insights and connect them to
> what I believe are irreducible qualities of Emacs qua software and
> Emacs as a community of like-minded people.  The talk will be
> theoretical in nature: there won't be any code-related demonstration
> nor technical references that only people with a background in
> computer science would likely recognise.  Personal anecdotes shall be
> tangential to the point and considered as ancillary to the thesis of
> what Emacs represents from the standpoint of software freedom and user
> empowerment.  The presentation is intended for a general audience that
> is interested in GNU software in general and Emacs in particular.  My
> formal educational background as a social scientist (i.e.  not a
> programmer) and later as a philosopher informs my approach to this
> topic.
> 
> The presentation shall be 40 minutes long.  Its text will be in essay
> form and shall be supplied as complementary material to the video.
> The notation will be in Org mode.

## Backstory

I had no intention to participate in the event, even though I was well
aware of it and despite the fact that I had followed the previous two
conferences.  My reasoning was that (i) I probably had no technical
insight to share that wasn't already known to the members of---and
likely participants in---such a setting, (ii) I already have my website
with a dedicated section on Emacs where I can publish any article or
video I want, and (iii) EmacsConf provides a platform for people who are
otherwise not disseminating their own stories to reach a wider audience.
Some or all of these assumptions may have been fallacious.  They still
represent what I believed at the time.

At around the end of September, a few days before the deadline for the
submission of proposals, someone knowledgeable of the conference's
logistics, whose name shall not be divulged, contacted me and asked me
to deliver a talk.  I was eventually persuaded to make an attempt at
taking a 20-minute slot, but it was not feasible to condense my thoughts
to such a short video, especially given the tight deadline (I was
preoccupied with other issues, including [the release of modus-themes
version 1.6.0](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-09-29-modus-themes-1-6-0/)
that was made just in time for the creation of the `emacs-28` branch in
emacs.git).  So I replied, perhaps with some relief, that I would not be
available for this year's event and would consider trying again the year
after.

To cut the long story short, the 40-minute slot was considered a viable
option and I made a last-ditch effort to submit an abstract before the
deadline.  It happened on the 30th of September.

There are lots of talks in this year's conference.  All seem very
interesting and I am looking forward to watch them.  Hopefully mine will
be worth it as well.
