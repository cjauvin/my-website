I did an interview with Yuvraj Singh of _Syntopikon_ where I comment
on Emacs, my experiences with computing, political themes, philosophy,
and general life issues:

An excerpt to get you started:

> 10\. In your About, you write that "What I wrote in the past may not
> represent my current views." What are some views that have changed
> or evolved over the past decade?
>
> [...] I used to express myself in a more verbose way that felt
> needlessly professorial.  My mistake was to believe that
> sophistication is found in jargon and statements that are hard to
> comprehend.  Whereas now I try to state my thoughts in plain terms.
> I have confidence in the depth of my views and know how to show that
> to the uninitiated.  I do this, for example, with my philosophy
> which is practical even though I can make it highly abstract and
> obscure.  When I read some philosopher's cavalierly writings, I get
> the sense they are being ridiculous with all that apparent
> pretentiousness.  I do not want to impress anyone, especially if
> that means I do not communicate my ideas clearly.  If I did fail
> this test in the past, it is a mistake I acknowledge through my
> current practice.  And if I am currently falling short on some
> front, I know I will be able to look back at it and accept it with
> honesty.

Syntopikon has interviews with other folks from the Emacs community.
