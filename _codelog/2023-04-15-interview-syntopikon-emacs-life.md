I did an interview with Yuvraj Singh of _Syntopikon_ where I comment
on Emacs, my experiences with computing, political themes, philosophy,
and general life issues:

Thanks to Yuvraj Singh for taking the time to do this!

<!-- 1. Who are you, and what do you do?
 !-- 
 !-- I am Protesilaos.  Some friends, especially English-speaking ones,
 !-- call me "Prot".  You are welcome to do the same.
 !-- 
 !-- I do a variety of things, most of which are reflected on my website.
 !-- I write/talk about philosophy, Emacs and free software, politics, and
 !-- related issues.  If I am to summarise all this in one word, that is
 !-- "tinkerer".  I proceed through trial and error.
 !-- 
 !-- 
 !-- 2. How did you get interested in that?
 !-- 
 !-- All of my current interests emerged organically through everyday life
 !-- experiences and/or coincidences.
 !-- 
 !-- Starting with the topic of my university studies---European
 !-- affairs---I did not actually have a prior interest in it.  As a
 !-- teenager, my mind was in football (soccer) and extracurricular
 !-- activities.  I did not like school.  The reason I picked that field
 !-- for my studies is because it involved foreign languages.  I thought
 !-- that was cool.
 !-- 
 !-- I became a philosopher gradually, as I kept reflecting on both the
 !-- theoretical aspects of my studies and the quotidian events I was
 !-- exposed to.  Since my early teenage years, I have been a keen student
 !-- of the human condition.  I have seen how people behave in different
 !-- circumstances and have a good way of reading individuals.  Philosophy
 !-- was the culmination of years of thinking about what we are doing in
 !-- our lives and why.  It also is what emancipated me from falsehoods
 !-- that are perpetuated through my culture in the form of social
 !-- expectations.
 !-- 
 !-- My interest in technology developed relatively late in my life.  The
 !-- first computer I bought was in 2018: it was a Lenovo ThinkPad X220.
 !-- While the first laptop I ever owned was a hand-me-down Macbook I got
 !-- at work in late 2012 or early 2013---I am not sure anymore.  Up until
 !-- the early 2010s I did not know anything about computers.  Not even
 !-- common keyboard shortcuts like Alt+Tab.  I remember that being a
 !-- revelation!  I still am bad at typing as I cannot touch type and
 !-- cannot keep my hands on the home row: they hover above the keyboard,
 !-- while I mostly use just the index on the left hand...  At any rate, I
 !-- switched to using free software in 2016 out of a desire to break free
 !-- from the increasingly constraining corporate control I was under.
 !-- First using the Macbook and then, when that broke, moving to the
 !-- ThinkPad.  For me this was always about freedom: I did not know the
 !-- technicalities.
 !-- 
 !-- Through daily use of GNU/Linux and its individual utilities, I learnt
 !-- more about software and computers in general.  I eventually configured
 !-- my bespoke setup that involved a tiling window manager (BSPWM is its
 !-- name), Tmux, Vim, XTerm, Mutt, Newsboat, and others.  Basically, I was
 !-- living in the terminal and was handling my files with core programs
 !-- like 'cd', 'cp', 'mv', and related.
 !-- 
 !-- My experience with those tools made me realise the limitation of the
 !-- Unix paradigm: the lack of an integrated layer of interactivity.  I
 !-- was not happy that I could not configure all my programs in a uniform
 !-- fashion.  Vim uses Vimscript, Ranger is done in Python, the window
 !-- manager expects shell scripting...  Each of those is excellent in its
 !-- own right, but the gestalt form is awkward.  The missing layer of
 !-- interactivity is apparent in wider workflows but also in little things
 !-- like setting a theme: it is not trivial to make all those programs
 !-- sing in concert.
 !-- 
 !-- As such, I switched to Emacs in the summer of 2019.  There I found
 !-- what I considered the missing piece of an otherwise nice Unix-y
 !-- system.  I have been using Emacs ever since and have also learnt how
 !-- to program a few things.  I did so by tinkering with Emacs until I
 !-- could eventually write fully fledged programs in Emacs Lisp.
 !-- 
 !-- 
 !-- 3. What resources could you suggest to people who want to learn how to
 !-- do what you do?
 !-- 
 !-- Given that most of what I learnt and am interested in came about
 !-- organically, it is hard to suggest a way to reproduce my experiences.
 !-- What I do is largely a matter of serendipity.  I did not follow anyone
 !-- and was not working towards something from the start.
 !-- 
 !-- Perhaps though there are some insights I can share.  One would be to
 !-- remain dubitative and inquisitive.  Learn things for yourself and try
 !-- to confirm what information you are exposed to and have an interest
 !-- in.  Instead of seeking out an influencer to follow, mark your own
 !-- path by asking "why" and following up on it.
 !-- 
 !-- Where possible, make a habit out of reading the official documentation
 !-- and relevant resources.  Do not sacrifice depth of knowledge for the
 !-- short-term convenience of getting an answer you can copy-paste.  Such
 !-- easy solutions give you the impression you are taking a shortcut while
 !-- getting things done, while they actually keep you in the same state of
 !-- powerlessness---you do not fully understand what you are doing.
 !-- 
 !-- Seek high quality reading materials and try to provide those wherever
 !-- you are involved.  For example, dismiss programs whose developer is
 !-- not considerate enough to write a decent manual for.  Not everyone is
 !-- a domain expert though all deserve to be empowered with the knowledge
 !-- of how things work and are configured.
 !-- 
 !-- As an aside here, we talk about software freedom in a manner that is
 !-- moralistic/legalistic.  That is fine, albeit inadequate.  For me, an
 !-- integral part of freedom is its availability.  How can one be free in
 !-- their computing, for instance, if the otherwise libre program they are
 !-- trying to use has poor documentation and an inaccessible interface?
 !-- Freedom presupposes empowerment and that comes about by tending to the
 !-- accessibility of the tool.
 !-- 
 !-- 
 !-- 4. What software, hardware, and other gear do you use on a regular
 !-- basis?
 !-- 
 !-- I used to have the Lenovo ThinkPad X220 that I mentioned.  It stopped
 !-- working a couple of years ago.  I still wish to fix it, though I never
 !-- had the luxury to do so.  I have since been working on a custom built
 !-- desktop computer that I bought with donations I got from the Emacs
 !-- community.  The computer is not super powerful, but it is more than
 !-- good enough for me---the laptop was already sufficient.
 !-- 
 !-- I recently got a smartphone, a Samsung A53, courtesy of a generous
 !-- donation.  I only use it for its camera and the occasional phone call
 !-- or SMS.  I do not do anything else with it.
 !-- 
 !-- In the indeterminate future I want to get a spare computer, perhaps a
 !-- laptop, so I can experiment with other operating systems such as Guix.
 !-- I cannot do it now because I cannot afford the downtime, plus I do not
 !-- have extra hardware for backing up my current files.
 !-- 
 !-- It would also be nice to acquire an ergonomic keyboard and a chair
 !-- that is comfortable to sit on for prolonged sessions.
 !-- 
 !-- On the software front, I use Emacs for virtually everything.  I write
 !-- prose and code with it, manage files, handle my email correspondence,
 !-- prepare my agenda, play back media files, read RSS feeds, browse the
 !-- Internet...  Most of my time on the computer is spent in front of an
 !-- Emacs frame.
 !-- 
 !-- I run a graphical web browser, mostly Firefox, when I need to access a
 !-- website that requires JavaScript.
 !-- 
 !-- The rest of my computing environment involves a tiling window manager
 !-- (BSPWM or HerbstluftWM), an application launcher (Rofi), a terminal
 !-- emulator (XTerm), and other specialised tools such as 'picom' for
 !-- display compositing and 'feh' to set a wallpaper.
 !-- 
 !-- All things considered, I have a stable setup through the years.  There
 !-- are incremental refinements and lots of improvements on the Emacs
 !-- front, though the overall experience is largely the same.
 !-- 
 !-- 
 !-- 5. You've written a lot about Emacs and publish or manage several
 !-- Emacs packages. What is it about Emacs that appeals to you?
 !-- 
 !-- It is the layer of interactivity on top of Unix.  With Emacs, I have
 !-- access to a powerful, programmable/extensible, customisable, and
 !-- introspectable system that empowers me to use my computer in a highly
 !-- opinionated way.  As I hinted at earlier, I care about the
 !-- accessibility of my tools.  When I need to be an expert in many
 !-- different programming languages just to achieve integration between my
 !-- programs, I feel disempowered.  Whereas with Emacs, I control things
 !-- uniformly by doing everything in Emacs Lisp.
 !-- 
 !-- I think Emacs is the embodiment of software freedom and its greatest
 !-- champion.  This is due to how configurable and transparent it is.
 !-- Though it also has to do with the strong documentation culture that
 !-- defines the development of the core program as well as packages in its
 !-- midst.  To offer a small indication, the absence of a docstring counts
 !-- as a warning while linting an Elisp program.  That is wonderful
 !-- because it nudges the developer to think about the user and to write
 !-- in plain terms what the code is doing.
 !-- 
 !-- Emacs trains you to expect a high standard of documentation.  You have
 !-- all sorts of ways to find information about what a key binding does,
 !-- what the value of a variable is, and so on.  The built-in Info reader
 !-- gives you access to high quality manuals while every package
 !-- maintainer in the Emacs community is expected to contribute to this
 !-- corpus of work.
 !-- 
 !-- Fundamentally, what I like about Emacs is that it teaches the user to
 !-- seek freedom in computing beyond the technicalities of the law.  I
 !-- would like every program to be Emacs-y in its behaviour and to aspire
 !-- to the highest standard of empowering the user to use their tools in a
 !-- manner that makes sense to them.
 !-- 
 !-- 
 !-- 6. There's a prevailing belief that Emacs has a steep learning curve
 !-- and requires plenty of setup, whereas something like VS Code can get
 !-- you started on your work quicker. Why invest the time to learn Emacs?
 !-- 
 !-- I think this belief is rooted in fact.  Emacs differs considerably
 !-- from other similar programs.  The familiar loop of starting up a
 !-- program, searching for a quick-n-dirty solution online, and then
 !-- continuing with the work does not make for a pleasant experience with
 !-- Emacs.
 !-- 
 !-- Instead, the user who wants to succeed long-term must put in the
 !-- effort to go through the official tutorial and read at least a little
 !-- bit of the manual.  Those who make a habit out of resorting to the
 !-- official help material and/or use the excellent self-documentation
 !-- commands will become happy Emacs users.  The rest will struggle with
 !-- that notorious learning curve and will feel bad about it.
 !-- 
 !-- While there are many tweaks we can make to improve the out-of-the-box
 !-- experience of Emacs, the fundamentals cannot be refashioned.  Users
 !-- still need to unlearn the bad habit of relying exclusively on online
 !-- searches for all their questions.  Much of what I read in fora is
 !-- already answered in plain terms in the docstring of some relevant
 !-- function/variable as well as the accompanying Info manual.  The user
 !-- has to learn how to retrieve that information.  This is the skill that
 !-- sets someone up for success; a skill worth developing into second
 !-- nature from the outset.
 !-- 
 !-- Other applications do offer convenience at the cost of keeping their
 !-- user in the same state of relative dependency they are in.  Most of
 !-- those users do not receive an impetus to be in control of their
 !-- computing environment.  They limit their role to that of a consumer.
 !-- When the app they use eventually goes out of fashion or its
 !-- development is discontinued, they throw away everything they built and
 !-- start again with whatever the new normal is.  This is wasteful and
 !-- ultimately disempowering.
 !-- 
 !-- If we always prioritise short-term convenience over longer-term
 !-- mastery, we eventually have no mastery at all as years go by.  We will
 !-- always feel helpless.  The time one invests in learning Emacs is time
 !-- well spent because the resulting knowledge can feed back into using
 !-- Emacs in a more refined way.  Emacs is extensible and will grow to
 !-- match the needs of its user.  There is a reason this program has been
 !-- around for almost half a century and that is because it can gracefully
 !-- adapt to changes and be the editor or integrated computing environment
 !-- its user needs.
 !-- 
 !-- As such, Emacs has a role to play in character building.  It teaches
 !-- the user to be patient and persistent.  It also exposes them to the
 !-- practical benefits of freedom, expressed through its introspectability
 !-- and customisability.  Choosing Emacs is not just a matter of deciding
 !-- how to edit text.  It largely is about what kind of person one wants
 !-- to be.
 !-- 
 !-- I know this sounds preposterous, as we are conditioned to think of
 !-- text editors as "text editors" and nothing else.  Though we can do
 !-- better than that by considering how one's tools have a profound effect
 !-- on one's disposition.
 !-- 
 !-- 
 !-- 7. What are some changes you'd like to see that you think would
 !-- improve Emacs?
 !-- 
 !-- I will keep this limited to what I think is achievable within the
 !-- status quo.  This is not to imply that I am not interested in
 !-- thoroughgoing enhancements, but only that I understand those require
 !-- considerable effort to be actualised.
 !-- 
 !-- I would provide a more opinionated set of defaults, accessible through
 !-- an opt-in mechanism at the end of the official tutorial.  There are
 !-- small tweaks, such as enabling 'delete-selection-mode', but also more
 !-- ambitious reforms in the spirit of enhancing the functionality of the
 !-- minibuffer with packages like 'vertico', 'marginalia', and
 !-- 'orderless'.
 !-- 
 !-- I would also add some rules to the 'display-buffer-alist'.  For
 !-- example, to make the 'calendar' command or Help buffers appear below
 !-- the current window.  Basically, to make the appearance of certain
 !-- transient elements less disruptive.
 !-- 
 !-- I would write a 'custom-file' to a file inside the user's directory
 !-- instead of the current intrusive---and confusing---default of
 !-- appending auto-generated text to the user's hand-written
 !-- initialisation file.  The 'custom-file' would be loaded early, to give
 !-- priority to whatever values the user specifies later in their
 !-- configuration.
 !-- 
 !-- Furthermore, I would change the behaviour of 'load-theme' to disable
 !-- all other active themes by default.  Expert users can always get back
 !-- the current behaviour via a toggle, whereas novices do not understand
 !-- why, say, the blend of 'modus-operandi' followed by 'wombat' is barely
 !-- usable even though each of those themes is fine in its own right.
 !-- 
 !-- 
 !-- 8. Which package (or packages) or bit of code that you've written are
 !-- you most proud of?
 !-- 
 !-- There are lots of little snippets I could share here, but I will keep
 !-- it generic instead.  I like the low-tech power that I get from the
 !-- file-naming scheme of 'denote'.  This is not code per se, though it
 !-- does improve my life considerably as all my files, from plain text
 !-- notes to lengthy videos, are easy to find.
 !-- 
 !-- 
 !-- 9. Your commentaries, interpretations, critiques, and other published
 !-- writing is a joy to read. Over more than a decade, you've made more
 !-- than 1,000 entries. Why write so much and often?
 !-- 
 !-- I write out of necessity.  I have this inner need to express myself
 !-- and do lose my sleep when I do not do what I must.  What keeps me
 !-- going is the attitude of not catering to an audience.  I simply speak
 !-- my mind.  If there is an audience, that is a happy coincidence, though
 !-- it never is my goal.
 !-- 
 !-- I think the most difficult part with public writing is how to deal
 !-- with feedback or, more likely, the absence thereof.  I learnt that
 !-- publishing my thoughts is of inherent worth to me and so I am not
 !-- disappointed by the lack of attention.
 !-- 
 !-- I rarely get comments beside the formulaic ones.  I never share my
 !-- publications on any "social" platform because I fundamentally am not
 !-- basing my creativity on what others think about my musings.  I avoid
 !-- reading what others write about me and do not try to influence any
 !-- such commentary.  I want to retain this aloofness.  It is a matter of
 !-- creative freedom and of not falling into the trap of being a persona
 !-- that vindicates the memes of some community.
 !-- 
 !-- This leads me to an aside on seeking validation.  We want to say
 !-- something that our peers approve of and thus are discouraged when we
 !-- eventually get no positive feedback on our work.  The solution to that
 !-- is to ask why do you like something.  Why are you passionate about
 !-- your favourite music, for example, and do not care whether your
 !-- friends listen to it or not?  It is the same with maintaining a
 !-- website.  Speak your mind with sincerity and without pretences.  Do it
 !-- because it fulfils you.  If you are wrong, take it gracefully.  If you
 !-- are congratulated for your efforts, treat it as if it never happened
 !-- and keep doing your thing with humility.
 !-- 
 !-- You may wonder, then, why publish my writings when I practically treat
 !-- them as a private affair?  The answer has to do with what I call
 !-- "accountability structures".  When we keep notes private, we are
 !-- inclined to dwell on them indefinitely.  We also get too comfortable
 !-- in the pattern of not subjecting our thoughts to scrutiny.  We become
 !-- too timid.  Whereas I want to maintain a record of what I think about
 !-- and do it in a manner I cannot rewrite.  This keeps me honest, as I
 !-- will err transparently, while it sets up a mechanism that triggers the
 !-- sportperson's competitiveness within me.
 !-- 
 !-- 
 !-- 10. In your About, you write that "What I wrote in the past may not
 !-- represent my current views." What are some views that have changed or
 !-- evolved over the past decade?
 !-- 
 !-- There probably are too many for me to enumerate.  What comes to mind
 !-- right now is a political theme.  I used to believe that the European
 !-- Union could be rendered approachable by turning it into a de jure
 !-- federal republic.  I now think this is not possible, given the path
 !-- dependencies of the project and the vested interests involved.  What
 !-- we have in place is a system that by its design engenders a phenomenon
 !-- I describe as "sovereignty mismatch".  We witness the uniformity of
 !-- power/authority over the whole area without the commensurate
 !-- accountability and legitimacy.  There is an EU-wide "state" apparatus,
 !-- though it is not described as such, without an EU-wide democracy.
 !-- While each member-state is a democracy, at least in principle, the
 !-- combination of them is not and cannot be given the particularities of
 !-- the architecture they operate in.  In short, I no longer believe in
 !-- the EU project, despite the fact that I remain a cosmopolite at heart
 !-- and want Europeans to prioritise their commonalities over their
 !-- differences.
 !-- 
 !-- There are also stylistic issues I have changed.  I used to express
 !-- myself in a more verbose way that felt needlessly professorial.  My
 !-- mistake was to believe that sophistication is found in jargon and
 !-- statements that are hard to comprehend.  Whereas now I try to state my
 !-- thoughts in plain terms.  I have confidence in the depth of my views
 !-- and know how to show that to the uninitiated.  I do this, for example,
 !-- with my philosophy which is practical even though I can make it highly
 !-- abstract and obscure.  When I read some philosopher's cavalierly
 !-- writings, I get the sense they are being ridiculous with all that
 !-- apparent pretentiousness.  I do not want to impress anyone, especially
 !-- if that means I do not communicate my ideas clearly.  If I did fail
 !-- this test in the past, it is a mistake I acknowledge through my
 !-- current practice.  And if I am currently falling short on some front,
 !-- I know I will be able to look back at it and accept it with honesty.
 !-- 
 !-- More generally, that proviso is a statement of intent.  My outlook is
 !-- to remain open to the possibility of change.  I do not strive to be
 !-- consistent and to follow whatever dogma, including my own.
 !-- 
 !-- 
 !-- 11. Are there any views that you thought wouldn't change, but did
 !-- change?
 !-- 
 !-- I used to believe in free market economics, thinking that they are the
 !-- natural order of things.  I eventually learnt that what we read from
 !-- textbooks contains a kernel of science upon which ideological
 !-- structures are established.  I figured we cannot decouple "the
 !-- economy" from social and political affairs, which themselves unfold
 !-- within a specific nexus of cultural-historical institutions.
 !-- Economics, like every field of intellectuality, embeds deep seated
 !-- values which it treats as objective facts.  The problem is that it
 !-- does it in a way that is hard to spot because we are immersed in this
 !-- milieu which is underpinned by those very values.
 !-- 
 !-- Another thought that changed was my passion for football (soccer).
 !-- When I was a teenager, I used to think that professional sport is
 !-- perfect.  My injury and the way I was cast aside taught me that
 !-- sportspeople are expendable and that the sport industry, with an
 !-- emphasis on "industry", does not care about the wellness of its
 !-- workers.  I remain a sportsperson in my disposition and am athletic
 !-- overall.  I still follow the Olympic ideal of fair competition and
 !-- continue to see the unity of the otherwise analytical constructs of
 !-- mind and body.  What I do not respect anymore is the commercial
 !-- version of sport: it runs contrary to the values it purports to
 !-- represent.
 !-- 
 !-- 
 !-- 12. You describe yourself as a philosopher. What is it to be a
 !-- philosopher, and to do philosophy?
 !-- 
 !-- It feels lonely.  I have no-one to talk to about my interests, while
 !-- those who quickly realise I am even remotely philosophical in my
 !-- thinking and speaking treat me as some sort of alien.  Not because I
 !-- do not make sense: they simply are afraid to commit a mistake,
 !-- thinking that I will berate them for not being smart enough or
 !-- something like that.  I loath the capable person who thinks they are
 !-- special and does not treat others kindly.  I am a keen listener and
 !-- encourage others to speak their mind.
 !-- 
 !-- The most common response I get from folk is some variant of
 !-- self-inhibition such as "I have not studied philosophy; I cannot teach
 !-- you anything."  In truth, they can teach me a lot even when they do
 !-- not realise it.  I tell people how they are mistaken in belittling
 !-- themselves and how philosophy is not about being books-smart.  I have
 !-- heard profound insights into life from people no-one would consider
 !-- wise.
 !-- 
 !-- Being a philosopher is about remaining dubitative and inquisitive.
 !-- This attitude applies to all affairs: it is not limited to some
 !-- experiment in a laboratory.  Ultimately though, to be a philosopher is
 !-- to be simple because you realise that your every answer leads to more
 !-- questions.  It all ends in a question mark, making you recognise your
 !-- insignificance.
 !-- 
 !-- 
 !-- 13. How do you relax or take a break?
 !-- 
 !-- I take long walks in nature.  I live in a mountainous region.  There
 !-- are pine forests here, while I enjoy hiking with my dog.  I used to
 !-- require breaks from what I was doing because my work and its
 !-- concomitant expectations were not consistent with my actuality.  We
 !-- need time off when what we do depletes us.  Though I no longer have
 !-- such a need.  My activities do not drain me of my vitality, so my
 !-- break time is a change of scenery rather than an escape from some
 !-- odious routine.
 !-- 
 !-- 
 !-- 14. Whose work inspires or motivates you, or that you admire?
 !-- 
 !-- The people I admire and am inspired by are the ones we would consider
 !-- unsung heroes.  They are unknown to the wider public.  Zakaria the
 !-- conscientious hairdresser, Maria the tireless bartender, Beran the
 !-- eager community-builder, Andreas the cheerful neighbour...  These are
 !-- people who show resilience in the face of hardship; who will give you
 !-- half a loaf of bread even though one is all they have.
 !-- 
 !-- What they know is what I have learnt as well: we do not truly own
 !-- anything; what we get is not ours to keep.  I want to offer everything
 !-- I do in freedom as I am taught from those fellows what it means to be
 !-- humble.  My hope is that my contributions can help someone out there
 !-- and inspire them to be a force for good in this world.
 !-- 
 !-- 
 !-- 15. Anything else you'd like to add?
 !-- 
 !-- Do not cling on to what you have out of some misplaced sense of duty
 !-- towards consistency.  Allow yourself the chance to change, to think
 !-- anew, to appreciate things in a different light.  Believe in yourself
 !-- and state your views respectfully yet unapologetically.  Be happy to
 !-- be proven wrong, as that emancipates you from whatever falsehood
 !-- governed your actions.  And when things do not go your way, smile
 !-- while readying yourself for the challenge ahead. -->
