title: "Emacs: my new 'sxhkdrc-mode' package"
excerpt: "The 'sxhkdrc-mode' package for Emacs provides a major mode for editing sxhkdrc files (Simple X Hot Key Daemon)."
---

This is a major mode for editing `sxhkdrc` files.  SXHKD is the
_Simple X Hot Key Daemon_ which is commonly used in minimalist desktop
sessions on Xorg, such as with the _Binary Space Partitioning Window
Manager_ (BSPWM).  The `sxhkdrc` file configures key chords, binding
them to commands.  For the technicalities, read the man page
`sxhkd(1)`.

This version of `sxhkdrc-mode` defines fontification rules, a way to
indent keys and commands, and sets up the file as a derivative of
`prog-mode`.  In future versions, we will consider adding support for
more features, depending on the needs of the community.
