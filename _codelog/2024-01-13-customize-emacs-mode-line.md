In this video I provide an overview of how to customise the Emacs mode
line colours. I show the `set-face-attribute` and `custom-set-faces`
functions and explain what the difference between them is in terms of
effect. I also discuss how to get a list of faces and supported
colours, as well as some parts that are specific to my themes (the
`modus-themes` in this case, though my `ef-themes` and
`standard-themes` have a similar design).

Also watch how to write a custom mode line:
