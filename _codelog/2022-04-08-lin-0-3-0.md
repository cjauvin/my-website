title: 'Emacs: lin version 0.3.0'
excerpt: 'Information about the latest version of my lin package for GNU Emacs.'

Lin is a stylistic enhancement for Emacs' built-in `hl-line-mode`.  It
remaps the `hl-line` face (or equivalent) buffer-locally to a style that
is optimal for major modes where line selection is the primary mode of
interaction.  Its manual explains the technicalities:
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/lin>.

Here is an illustration of Lin in the lower window as compared to the
default subtle style of `hl-line-mode` in the upper window (using the
`modus-operandi` theme from [my
modus-themes](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes) package):

Below are the release notes.

## Version 0.3.0 on 2022-04-08

-   Changed the source repository from GitLab to SourceHut:
    <https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/lin>.  Use the mailing list to start a
    discussion, report a bug, send a patch, etc.:
    <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/lin>.  The GitLab URL will serve as
    a mirror from now on (a GitHub mirror is still available and will
    remain that way).

-   Introduced a buffer-local minor mode as well as its global equivalent:
    `lin-mode` and `lin-global-mode`.  This makes it easier to set up Lin
    in user init files and/or toggle it on demand.  The following shows
    how the package can be used:
    
        (require 'lin)
        
        (setq lin-face 'lin-blue) ; check doc string for alternative styles
        
        ;; You can use this to live update the face:
        ;;
        ;; (customize-set-variable 'lin-face 'lin-green)
        
        (setq lin-mode-hooks
              '(bongo-mode-hook
                dired-mode-hook
                elfeed-search-mode-hook
                git-rebase-mode-hook
                ibuffer-mode-hook
                ilist-mode-hook
                ledger-report-mode-hook
                log-view-mode-hook
                magit-log-mode-hook
                mu4e-headers-mode
                notmuch-search-mode-hook
                notmuch-tree-mode-hook
                occur-mode-hook
                org-agenda-mode-hook
                tabulated-list-mode-hook))
        
        (lin-global-mode 1)

-   The `lin-face` now has a custom setter which automatically updates its
    appearance in all buffers where `lin-mode` is enabled.  Users might
    thus prefer to set its value with `customize-set-variable` in order to
    find the style they like the most.  Otherwise setting the value with
    `setq` is just fine for stable configurations.  If, in that case, the
    user wants to update the face, they must invoke `revert-buffer` or
    equivalent (e.g. type `g` in Dired with the default key bindings) or
    evaluate the function `lin-enable-mode-in-buffers`.

-   The user option `lin-mode-hooks` now includes `bongo-mode-hook` (from
    the `bongo` package).  Its default value is shown in the sample code
    above.
