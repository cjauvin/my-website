excerpt: "I added another theme to my 'ef-themes' collection.  It is a legible dark theme with blue, green, cyan, gold colors."

The `ef-symbiosis` theme is now part of my `ef-themes` collection
(pronounced as "F themes").  It is a highly legible dark theme with blue,
green, cyan, gold colors.

Sample pictures are shown below.  Also check the entire set:

## Coming in version 1.0.0 (next stable release)

`ef-symbiosis` is under development.  Its character is clearly defined
though I may still refine some of its secondary aspects.

The `ef-themes` are a collection of light and dark themes for GNU Emacs
whose goal is to provide colorful ("pretty") yet legible options for
users who want something with a bit more flair than the `modus-themes`
(also designed by me).
