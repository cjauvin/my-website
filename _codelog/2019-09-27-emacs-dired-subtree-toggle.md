In this short video I explain how I was able to discover two
_undocumented_ functions of `dired-subtree`, which define a toggle and a
cyclical behaviour for expanding or contracting a subdirectory inside of
Dired.  I also discuss how to use the built-in methods of Emacs to
discover such hidden features.

And this is a link to my configuration file, with all the settings I
showed in the video as well as everything else, from previous screen
casts: [protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs).
