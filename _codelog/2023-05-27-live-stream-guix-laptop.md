I got a new laptop: Lenovo ThinkPad X470.  This is a gift from Anush
V, to whom I am thankful.  I will be using this device to experiment
with Guix, a distro I have been following since ~2017 but never had
the hardware to test it on.  These will be my first impressions.

The video is recorded and can be viewed at any time.  No worries if
you cannot make it.  I am posting this on 09:08 +0300.
