In this video I demonstrate the text-based web browser that is built
into Emacs: `eww`, or else the "Emacs Web Wowser".  While it is quite
usable without any customisations, I have written several extensions for
it to make my quotidian usage a bit more pleasant.

Refer to my Emacs configuration file ("dotemacs") for the implementation
details: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs>.  The specific item that
contains those extensions is `prot-eww.el`.  Everything is part of my
dotfiles' repository: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles>.
