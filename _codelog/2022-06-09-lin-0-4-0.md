title: 'Emacs: lin version 0.4.0'
excerpt: 'Information about the latest version of my lin package for GNU Emacs.'

Lin is a stylistic enhancement for Emacs' built-in `hl-line-mode`.  It
remaps the `hl-line` face (or equivalent) buffer-locally to a style that
is optimal for major modes where line selection is the primary mode of
interaction.  In concrete terms: (i) let your theme use a subtle gray to
highlight the current line in text-editing buffers like Org, and (ii)
render the current line with a more prominent colour in Dired, Ibuffer,
et cetera.  Why?  Because the two types of interaction have different
requirements about how intensely the current line should be highlighted.

Sample configuration:

```elisp
(require 'lin)

(setq lin-face 'lin-blue) ; check doc string for alternative styles

;; You can use this to live update the face:
;;
;; (customize-set-variable 'lin-face 'lin-green)

;; This is the default value
(setq lin-mode-hooks
      '(bongo-mode-hook
        dired-mode-hook
        elfeed-search-mode-hook
        git-rebase-mode-hook
        grep-mode-hook
        ibuffer-mode-hook
        ilist-mode-hook
        ledger-report-mode-hook
        log-view-mode-hook
        magit-log-mode-hook
        mu4e-headers-mode
        notmuch-search-mode-hook
        notmuch-tree-mode-hook
        occur-mode-hook
        org-agenda-mode-hook
        proced-mode-hook
        tabulated-list-mode-hook))

(lin-global-mode 1)
```

Below are the release notes.

-   The official Git repository is now hosted on SourceHut.  Mirrors are
    available on GitHub and GitLab&#x2014;users can open issues there if they
    find it difficult to use the mailing list.  The sources:
    -   Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/lin>
    -   Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/lin-changelog>

    -   Mailing list: <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/lin>

-   The `grep-mode-hook` and `proced-mode-hook` are included in the
    default value of the user option `lin-mode-hooks`.  This practically
    means that Lin will be active in the implied modes when
    `lin-global-mode` is enabled.  Thanks to Nicolas De Jaeghere for the
    patch (Nicolas has assigned copyright to the Free Software
    Foundation).

-   The faces that leverage the macOS palette (`lin-mac{,-override-fg}`)
    are made to work with Mitsuharu Yamamoto's `emacs-mac` port:
    <https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/src/master/>.  They read the
    `mac` display specification in addition to the `ns` one.  Remember
    that you can specify the desired face as the value of `lin-face` (its
    doc string documents all the stylistic options we provide).  Thanks to
    Kai von Fintel for the patch (the change is well below the ~15 line
    threshold for copyright assignment).
