In this screen cast I demonstrate the power of Emacs' `occur`
function using a real-world scenario.

On the face of it, `occur` is similar to `grep`: it outputs a list of
results matching a search pattern.  However, these results can be
interfaced with and can even be edited directly, with all changes
echoed to the actual file.

As such, `occur` can be used as a "scoping" or "narrowing" tool to
limit the buffer to certain terms.  Then the full editing capabilities
of Emacs can be put to use: replacing using regular expressions,
keyboard macros, external packages such as `multiple-cursors`, etc.

I can already state with confidence that Emacs is a powerhouse of
productivity once you familiarise yourself with its tools and
utilities.
