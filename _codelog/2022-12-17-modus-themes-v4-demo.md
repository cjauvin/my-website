In this video, I demonstrate how the new theme palettes work with the
inclusion of the abstraction of "semantic colour mappings".  The user
can now override every single entry in the palette, thus refashioning
every aspect of the theme.

This is a flexible and powerful mechanism that gives users near
complete control over the looks of the theme.  As such, I am
deprecating user options that produced colour variations, as those
were not flexible and made the code base much more complex.

The new version remains in development (check the `version-4`
branch). I plan to merge it into `main` in the coming days and
formalise the release by the end of December 2022 or the beginning of
January 2023.
