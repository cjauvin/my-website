[Bryan Lunduke has a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVst8HK-2EY)
where he argues that technology is not political and, by extension, free
software is just a technical endeavour.

Here is the part of his opinion that is specifically about free software
and which I use as a basis for my counterpoint:

>Once you see something as a movement of people with an ideology,
>politics comes into play with that.  And to say that there are no
>politics involved in free software would clearly be wrong.  Clearly
>that would be wrong.  However, free software, in and of itself, is not
>political at all.  **It is simply a license applied to software where
>source code is available.**

In my video I also refer to a case that Richard Stallman talks about in
one of his presentations.  It concerns a printer and the proprietary
software it came with.  This is [the
transcript](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/rms-nyu-2001-transcript.txt).

I usually do video tutorials about Emacs and other technical free
software topics such as the Binary Space Partitioning Window Manager.
Stay tuned for more.
