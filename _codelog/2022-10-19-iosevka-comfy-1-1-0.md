_Iosevka Comfy_ is a customised build of the [Iosevka

rounded style and overrides for almost all individual glyphs in both
roman (upright) and italic (slanted) variants.

Below are the release notes.

* * *

* Made the `@` and `%` characters wider in the font families
  `iosevka-comfy-duo`, `iosevka-comfy-motion-duo`, `iosevka-comfy-wide`,
  `iosevka-comfy-wide-fixed`, `iosevka-comfy-wide-duo`.  This is
  consistent with their design, which has wider glyphs and/or more
  generous spacing.

* Built using upstream Iosevka `v16.3.4`, commit `ad1e247a`.

The rest of the design remains the same as before.  Read the detailed
