title: 'Emacs: logos version 0.4.0'
excerpt: 'Information about the latest version of my logos package for GNU Emacs.'
---

Logos is a nimble tool that provides the means for a simple focus mode
utilising page breaks and/or outline headings.  [Watch the demo of
logos.el](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-03-11-emacs-logos-demo/)
(though every one of my videos since early 2022 uses `logos`) and refer
to [the manual](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/logos) for the relevant
details.

Below are the release notes.

* * *

-   The Git repo is now hosted on SourceHut.  Mirrors are available on
    GitHub and GitLab&#x2014;users can open issues there if they find it
    difficult to use the official mailing list.  The sources:
    -   Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/logos>
    -   Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/logos-changelog>
    -   Git repo on SourceHut: <https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/logos>
        -   Mirrors:
            -   GitHub: <https://github.com/protesilaos/logos>
            -   GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/logos>
    -   Mailing list: <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/logos>

-   The new user option `logos-hide-fringe` conceals the fringe by
    applying the same background as the default face.  It does not
    interfere with `fringe-mode`, such as by adjusting its size.  This
    option complements `logos-olivetti` and is only relevant if the
    `fringe` face has a distinct background.

-   The new `logos-focus-mode-extra-functions` is an ordinary hook that
    unlocks the potential of `logos-focus-mode` by allowing the user to
    trigger any effect when the mode is toggled.  Its doc string
    references functions from `logos.el` that can be adapted at the user
    level to pursue varied ends, while the manual furnishes a ready-to-use
    sample for `org-indent-mode`.  This feature was inspired by the
    inquiry of Ypot in issue 1 over at the GitHub mirror:
    <https://github.com/protesilaos/logos/issues/1>.

-   The default value of the user option `logos-outline-regexp-alist` now
    includes an entry for `markdown-mode` to determine what constitutes a
    heading there.  This helps with motions such as
    `logos-forward-page-dwim` while it makes Markdown equally useful for a
    focused reading or presentation (with `logos-focus-mode`).

-   The manual includes a link to a publication of mine where I explain
    what the "devel" version of GNU ELPA is and how to make use of it:
