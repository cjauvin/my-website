title: "Emacs: denote version 0.6.0"
excerpt: 'Information about the latest version of my Denote package for GNU Emacs.'
---

Denote is a simple note-taking tool.  It is based on the idea that notes
should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming scheme.  The
file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is about,
without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically streamlines
the creation of such files while providing facilities to link between
them.

Denote is in a stable state.  I consider it feature-complete, without
prejudice to possible refinements to its existing feature set.  The next
version shall be `1.0.0`.


## User-facing changes

-   The Denote linking facility can now link to any file that has the
    Denote file-naming scheme.  Before, we limited this feature to what we
    consider "note" files, else the supported plain text formats (per
    `denote-file-type`).  Thanks to Peter Prevos for the discussion on the
    mailing list: <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C87fsi1m5ze.fsf%40prevos.net%3E>.

-   Date prompts may optionally use the familiar Org date-selection
    mechanism that leverages the calendar.  This feature is subject to the
    user option `denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date`.  A date prompt is
    used by the `denote-date` command or, optionally, by the `denote`
    command when the user option `denote-prompts` is configured
    accordingly.  The manual elaborates on the specificities.  Thanks to
    Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the contribution in pull request 97 at
    the GitHub mirror: <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/97>.

-   Leading empty spaces at the `denote` `TITLE` prompt no longer produce
    hyphens: they are simply ignored to keep file names consistent.
    Thanks to Peter Prevos for the contribution in pull request 99 at the
    GitHub mirror: <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/99>.

    [ Peter has started the process for copyright assignment to the Free
      Software Foundation, though the total contributions are still within
      the permitted boundaries. ]

-   When linking to files that have no front matter, the link's anchor
    text (the human-readable part) is derived from the file name `TITLE`
    component.  We apply a de-hyphenation and capitalisation of its
    constituent words.  This is not always perfect, but it is better than
    something like `this-is-the-title`.  Thanks to Peter Prevos for the
    original idea in pull request 93 at the GitHub mirror:
    <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/93>.

-   The active region is now used as the default value of the `denote`
    command `TITLE` prompt.  The idea behind this Do-What-I-Mean-flavoured
    patch is to be able to take a note about a subject that appears in a
    buffer by simply marking it before invoking the `denote` command.

    Thanks to Eshel Yaron for the patch: <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/34870>.
    It is below the ~15 line threshold that thus requires no copyright
    assignment to the Free Software Foundation.

-   The `denote-rename-file-using-front-matter` command now offers to save
    the buffer if appropriate.  In the past, it would simply produce an
    error asking the user to save the buffer.  Thanks to Peter Prevos for
    the contribution in pull request 103 at he GitHub mirror:
    <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/103>.

-   Fixed the text of the confirmation prompt in the command
    `denote-migrate-old-markdown-yaml-tags`.  Thanks to Abin Simon for the
    patch: <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/34632>.

    This patchset also fixes (i) how a tag is identified for the purposes
    of migrating old to new front matter, (ii) the regular expression for
    Org front matter keywords

    [ The total changes are below the ~15 line threshold and thus do not
      require copyright assignment to the Free Software Foundation. ]

-   Fixed a bug that prevented the creation of new notes.  Thanks to
    Juergen Hoetzel for the contribution in pull request 84 at the GitHub
    mirror: <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/84>.  This was
    done immediately after the release of version `0.5.0` on 2022-08-10
    and was provided to users as version `0.5.1`

    [ The change is below the ~15 line threshold. ]


## Internal refinements

These make the code simpler and more predictable.  As the individual
changes are not user-facing, I invite interested parties to consult the
Git log.  Special thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the multiple
contributions (and relevant discussions) over at the GitHub mirror:

-   <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/88>
-   <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/89>
-   <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/91>
-   <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/94>
-   <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/101>
-   <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/102>

  It is required for non-trivial changes. ]


## For advanced users

The variable `denote-file-types` is an alist of plists which
substantiates the supported file types (per the user option
`denote-file-type`).  Properties pertain to the formatting of front
matter and the retrieval of relevant values.  The doc string of
`denote-file-types` explains the details, while the default value uses
the ancillary functions we define.  Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay
for the relevant contributions in pull request 89 at the GitHub mirror:
<https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/89>.
