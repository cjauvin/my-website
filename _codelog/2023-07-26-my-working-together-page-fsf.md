excerpt: "The Free Software Foundation has a profile of me where I comment on GNU Emacs."

A while ago I was asked to provide a brief comment on Emacs for the
FSF's _Working Together_ series.  Here it is:
<https://www.fsf.org/working-together/profiles/prot>.

The accompanying article, titled [The campaigns team and the community
work together for free software](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/the-campaigns-team-and-the-community-work-together-for-free-software), states thus:

> Next, we hear from fellow [Free Software
> Award](https://www.fsf.org/news/free-software-awards-winners-announced-securepairs-protesilaos-stavrou-paul-eggert)
> winner [Protesilaos
> Stavrou](https://www.fsf.org/working-together/profiles/prot) on what
> motivates his work on GNU Emacs. In addition to his prolific writing
> and recorded introductory GNU Emacs materials, Prot is the developer
> of the Denote and Logos packages, as well as the Modus and Ef color
> themes. As Prot is a relative newcomer to free software development
> and the free software movement, his work shows how much a dedicated
> beginner can learn and accomplish in a short amount of time.

Check the article for more information.  Thanks to the folks at the
FSF for doing this!
