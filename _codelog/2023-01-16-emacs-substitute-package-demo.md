In this video I showcase my new package for Emacs.  It streamlines
certain text substitution routines I used to do with built-in
commands.  Quote from the project's README:

> Substitute is a set of commands that perform text replacement (i)
> throughout the buffer, (ii) limited to the current definition (per
> `narrow-to-defun`), (iii) from point to the end of the buffer, and
> (iv) from point to the beginning of the buffer.
>
> These substitutions are meant to be as quick as possible and, as
> such, differ from the standard `query-replace` (which I still use).
> The provided commands prompt for substitute text and perform the
> substitution outright.

I will add the package to GNU ELPA.  Expect it to be available shortly
after this publication goes live.
