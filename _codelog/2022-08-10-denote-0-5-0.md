title: "Emacs: denote version 0.5.0"
excerpt: 'Information about the latest version of my Denote package for GNU Emacs.'
---

Denote is a simple note-taking tool.  It is based on the idea that notes
should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming scheme.  The
file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is about,
without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically streamlines
the creation of such files while providing facilities to link between
them.

Below are the release notes.

* * *

The general theme of this release is to refine what we already offer.
As I explained in some discussions, Denote is feature-complete.  We can
always improve the code or add some ancillary function/command/variable,
though all the main ideas have already been implemented.  Additional
functionality can be provided by other packages: I remain at the
disposal of anyone willing to write such a package.

The present release covers more than 150 commits since version 0.4.0 on
2022-07-25.

All release notes: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote-changelog>.


## Templates for new notes

We now provide the `denote-templates` user option.  A "template" is
arbitrary text that Denote will add to a newly created note right below
the front matter.

Templates are expressed as a `(KEY . STRING)` association.

-   The `KEY` is the name which identifies the template.  It is an
    arbitrary symbol, such as `report`, `memo`, `statement`.

-   The `STRING` is ordinary text that Denote will insert as-is.  It can
    contain newline characters to add spacing.  The manual of Denote
    contains examples on how to use the `concat` function, beside writing
    a generic string:
    <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:f635a490-d29e-4608-9372-7bd13b34d56c>.

The user can choose a template either by invoking the new command
`denote-template` or by changing the user option `denote-prompts` to
always prompt for a template when calling the `denote` command.

Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for refinements to this facility.

## Revised format for Org `#+filetags` entry

Denote used to format tags in Org files by separating them with two
spaces:

    #+filetags:  tag1  tag2

While this worked for some obvious use-cases, it is not supported by
Org.  The Org documentation stipulates that tags be separated by the
colon sign.  The above would then be written thus:

    #+filetags:  :tag1:tag2:

Denote now conforms with Org's specifications.  To help users update
their existing notes, we provide the `denote-migrate-old-org-filetags`
command.  It will perform the conversion in all Org files that had the
old notation.  As with all Denote operations that rewrite file contents,
it DOES NOT SAVE BUFFERS.  The user is expected to review the changes,
such as by using `diff-buffer-with-file`.  Multiple buffers can be saved
with `save-some-buffers` (check its doc string).

This command is provided for the convenience of the user.  It shall be
deprecated and eventually removed from future versions of Denote.

If you need help with any of this, please do not hesitate to contact me
either in private or in one of Denote's official channels (mailing list,
GitHub/GitLab mirror).

Thanks to Alan Schmitt for bringing this matter to my attention:
<https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C871qu0jw5l.fsf%40protesilaos.com%3E>.
Also thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for commenting on it as it
helped me decide to include the command in `denote.el`:
<https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/83#issuecomment-1210167133>.


## Revised format for Markdown+YAML `tags:` entry

This is the same idea as above.  Before, we were making the mistake of
using incorrect YAML notation:

    tags:  tag1  tag2

Now we do:

    tags:  ["tag1", "tag2"]

This is how the TOML variant always worked.

For the user's convenience, we provide a command to migrate from the old
to the new syntax: `denote-migrate-old-markdown-yaml-tags`.


## Changes to file renaming and front matter rewriting

Denote adds "front matter" to newly created notes which includes data
such as the title and keywords/tags of the document.  Strictly speaking,
the front matter is not required by Denote.  It is provided for the
user's convenience, such as for readability or if they want to use the
note with other programs (e.g. Org export, a blog with Hugo/Jekyll,
&#x2026;).

Denote provides commands which help the user rename their notes, by
changing the file name's `TITLE` and/or `KEYWORDS` components (per
Denote's file-naming scheme).  These commands also operate on the front
matter to keep the data between file name and file contents in sync
(again, for the user's convenience).

For this release we have consolidated and refined our offerings in order
to improve their ergonomics.  All changes are the result of fruitful
discussions on the mailing list and the issue tracker of the GitHub
mirror:

### Renaming a single file

The commands `denote-dired-rename-file-and-add-front-matter` and
`denote-dired-rename-file` are deprecated and superseded by the new
`denote-rename-file`.  Please update any key bindings in your setup.

The difference between the old commands and the new `denote-rename-file`
is that the latter will now insert front matter to supported file types
(per `denote-file-type`) if they have none.  This basically means that,
e.g., renaming a generic Org/Markdown/Plain text file with
`denote-rename-file` will update its file name to comply with Denote's
file-naming scheme and also add the appropriate front matter (it
"converts" it to a Denote note).  If front matter exists, this command
will rewrite it to reflect the changes to the file name's `TITLE` and/or
`KEYWORDS`.

Consult the manual for the details:
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:7cc9e000-806a-48da-945c-711bbc7426b0>.

Or, if the new version of the GNU ELPA package is installed, evaluate:

    (info "(denote) Rename a single file")

The user option `denote-dired-rename-expert` is obsolete.  Denote always
asks for confirmation when renaming a single file.  This is because the
user can rely on batch-renaming commands which ask for confirmation only
once per batch.


### Renaming multiple files at once

The command `denote-dired-rename-marked-files-and-add-front-matter` is
deprecated and its functionality is absorbed by the existing
`denote-dired-rename-marked-files` command.  The deprecated command was
used to insert front matter to supported file types (per
`denote-file-type`) that had none.  We now handle this internally, thus
streamlining the experience for the user.

Refer to the manual for the details:
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:1b6b2c78-42f0-45b8-9ef0-6de21a8b2cde>

Assuming the latest Info manual is installed, evaluate:

    (info "(denote) Rename multiple files at once")


### Renaming a single file based on its front matter

Introduced the `denote-rename-file-using-front-matter` command.  This is
new functionality we provide which uses the front matter as input to
perform a rename of the file.  The aforementioned offerings prompt for
input via the minibuffer and propagate the changes firstly to the file
name and subsequently to the front matter.  Whereas with the command
`denote-rename-file-using-front-matter`, the user can edit the front
matter manually and then invoke the command to pass the changes to the
file name, subject to a confirmation.  Relevant entries are the title
and tags/filetags (depending on the file type).  The date and the
identifier are not pertinent.  Identifiers in file names are NEVER
rewritten by Denote.

Consult the manual:
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:3ab08ff4-81fa-4d24-99cb-79f97c13a373>.

With the latest package, evaluate:

    (info "(denote) Rename a single file based on its front matter")


### Renaming multiple files based on their front matter

The command `denote-dired-rename-marked-files-using-front-matter`
completes the set of features we provide for syncing between file name
and front matter.  It applies to all marked files in a Dired buffer.

Read the manual to understand how the command works and what it does
exactly: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:ea5673cd-e6ca-4c42-a066-07dc6c9d57f8>.

Or evaluate:

    (info "(denote) Rename multiple files based on their front matter")


### Add missing front matter on demand

Sometimes the user may have incomplete front matter, perhaps due to a
mistake that was saved on disk.  The command `denote-add-front-matter`
appends a new front matter block to the current note.

Read:
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:54b48277-e0e5-4188-ad54-ef3db3b7e772>

Or evaluate:

    (info "(denote) Regenerate front matter")


## Faces for Denote links

We provide the `denote-faces-link` and the `denote-faces-broken-link`.
The latter is only relevant for Org, as Emacs' standard button mechanism
does not have a way to apply a face dynamically.

This is a change for themes/tinkerers who need to differentiate
`denote:` links from other links.  Otherwise, the presentation is the
same as before.

Thanks to Peter Prevos for asking about it on the mailing list:
<https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C03618bb20d3eaba78c32cd0cb63bfc71%40prevos.net%3E>.


## Use of XDG path in `denote-directory`

The default value of the `denote-directory` user option used to be
`~/Documents/notes` (subject to some conversion via Elisp).  Denote now
conforms with the freedesktop.org specifications by using the `XDG`
directory for `DOCUMENTS` instead of `~/Documents`:
<https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs/>.

Users who already bind the `denote-directory` are not affected by this
change.  Same for those who do not tinker with `XDG` environment
variables and/or do not use some exotic setup.

Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for the patch:
<https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/34561#%3C20220809115824.43089-1-philipk@posteo.net%3E>


## Bespoke major-mode for the backlinks' buffer

The backlinks' buffer now uses the `denote-backlink-mode` instead of the
generic `special-mode`.  The former derives from the latter.  It binds
keys to move between links with `n` (next) and `p` (previous).  These
are stored in the `denote-backlink-mode-map` (use `M-x describe-mode`
(`C-h m`) in an unfamiliar buffer to learn more about it).

Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for the patch:
<https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/34561#%3C20220809115824.43089-2-philipk@posteo.net%3E>


## Changes to the manual

-   Documented all of the aforementioned.  Improved how information is
    presented and, generally, iterated on an already comprehensive
    document.

-   Introduced a node which explains how to tweak the front matter:
    <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:7f918854-5ed4-4139-821f-8ee9ba06ad15>.
    Or evaluate:
    
        (info "(denote) Change the front matter format")

-   Updated the reference to `consult-notes`.  This is a package that uses
    the `consult` interface to provide access and search facilities for
    notes.  It can integrate with Denote.  Thanks to Colin McLear for the
    change in pull request 70 on the GitHub mirror:
    <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/70>.
    
    [ The change is below the ~15 line threshold and thus does not require
      copyright assignment to the Free Software Foundation. ]


## Internal restructuring

-   All Denote code is consolidated in `denote.el`.  We no longer maintain
    separate files like `denote-link.el`, `denote-dired.el`, etc.  Users
    who had `require` calls to such libraries must remove them and only
    keep:
    
        (require 'denote)

-   User options that have an entry in the manual will now provide a link
    to it via their Help buffer and/or the Custom UI.  This is done by
    adding the `:link` attribute to their declaration.
    
    Furthermore, user options and faces now specify the version of Denote
    that last affected their value (e.g. `denote-directory`, which was
    mentioned above for the XDG spec, now informs the user that it changed
    for version `0.5.0`).
    
    [ I learnt these by developing the `modus-themes`. ]

-   The variables `denote-last-title`, `denote-last-keywords`,
    `denote-last-buffer`, and `denote-last-front-matter` are all obsolete.
    These were used prior to version `0.1.0` to help with development but
    are now deemed surplus to requirements.

-   Lots of changes were made to private functions, variables, doc
    strings, and comments, in the interest of simplifying the code and/or
    ensuring consistency in how operations are carried out.  Though
    everything is the same for the end-user.

Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the numerous contributions on the
GitHub mirror.  They are important for Denote, though the user does not
need to know what is happening internally (consult the Git log for the
details):

## Discussions


### Encrypting Denote notes

Paul van Gelder asked about this on the mailing list.  I provided
guidelines on what can be done, though did not record anything in the
manual: I prefer to elicit more feedback from users.  The gist is that
Emacs already has all the requisite functionality, though encryption per
se is outside the scope of Denote:
<https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C1123434736.64290.1658954014673%40kpc.webmail.kpnmail.nl%3E>.

Denote's relevant internal mechanisms will recognise files ending in
`.gpg` (e.g. for fontification in Dired).


### Visualise usage of Denote keywords

Peter Prevos shared a proof-of-concept way to visualise keywords in the
`denote-directory` and show usage statistics:
<https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3Ce9e5d6ae85984b51067b47f4d8e134fa%40prevos.net%3E>.

We do not include this information in the manual, as we wait for the
fully fledged code.  Though do give it a try if you are interested and,
perhaps, share your thoughts for Peter's consideration.


### Conflict between `denote-dired-mode` and `diredfl-mode`

Hilde Rhyne shared a workaround they have to disable `diredfl-mode` in
the buffers where `denote-dired-mode` is enabled.  The conflict between
the two is a known issue that is acknowledged in the manual:
<https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3Cm0tu6q6bg0.fsf%40disroot.org%3E>.

I think we need a proper solution in the code we provide, so this
workaround is not mentioned in the manual.


### Why doesn't Denote provide a search facility?

There was a discussion started by Fourchaux, with the participation of
basaran and Andre0991 on the GitHub mirror:
<https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/71>.

The gist of my answer is that Denote does not need to provide such a
facility because notes are ordinary files: whatever the user already has
for them should apply to Denote.  If the user has nothing to search
through files, they anyhow need something that works outside the
confines of Denote: a `denote-SEARCH` command is not an adequate
solution.

Emacs has numerous built-in commands, such as `grep` (`lgrep` and
`rgrep`), `project-find-regexp`, `find-grep-dired`, `ibuffer-do-occur`,
&#x2026;  Furthermore, there are lots of high quality packages that have
their own wrappers or extensions for searching file contents, such as
the `ivy` and `helm` completion frameworks, as well as `consult` (the
commands `consult-grep` and `consult-ripgrep`), `consult-notes`, `rg`,
`deadgrep`, `deft`, and probably plenty more that do not come to mind
right now.

I strongly encourage the user to find a universal search solution to the
problem of searching file contents.
