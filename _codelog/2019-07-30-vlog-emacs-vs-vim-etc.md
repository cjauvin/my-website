In this screen cast I offer my opinion on some of the common debates
in the free software space about which is the best text editor, tiling
window manager, desktop environment, etc.

My approach is to consider the context: the user and their needs.
There is a tool for every person and every niche.  What we should
always keep in mind is the spirit of free software: sharing the
knowledge and, thus, being altruistic.  We do not want elitism.
