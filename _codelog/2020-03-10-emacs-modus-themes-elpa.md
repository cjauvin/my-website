In this video I announce the immediate availability of my themes for
Emacs through the official package archive.  I explain what this means
in practice, how the new legal arrangements stand, and talk about my
plans concerning the ongoing development of this project.

The “Modus themes” are my highly-accessible themes for GNU Emacs. They
conform with the WCAG AAA standard for colour contrast accessibility,
which stands for a minimum contrast ratio of 7:1 between the foreground
and background values.

The two themes are:

+ `modus-operandi-theme` (light)
+ `modus-vivendi-theme` (dark)

Here is the link to the [GitLab repo of the Modus themes](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes).

You might want to send your feedback concerning the proposed changes to
`diff-mode` that I mentioned in the video.  If you do not have a GitLab
account, feel free to [contact me](https://protesilaos.com/contact/) via email.
