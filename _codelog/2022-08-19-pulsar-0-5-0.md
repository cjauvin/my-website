excerpt: 'Information about the latest version of my pulsar package for GNU Emacs.'

Pulsar is a small package that temporarily highlights the current line,
either on demand or automatically after invoking a function that is
present in a user-defined list.  [Watch the

-   Added convenience functions/commands to pulse a line using one of the
    provided faces.  These can be used interactively or via Lisp (e.g. be
    assigned to a hook).  They are:
    -   `pulsar-pulse-line-red`
    -   `pulsar-pulse-line-green`
    -   `pulsar-pulse-line-yellow`
    -   `pulsar-pulse-line-blue`
    -   `pulsar-pulse-line-magenta`
    -   `pulsar-pulse-line-cyan`

-   Deprecated `pulsar-pulse-on-window-change` due to complications it
    created in some edge cases.  Part of this effort was to fix a bug that
    pertained to a duplicate pulse when the pulsar commands were invoked
    via `M-x`.  The duplication had the effect of potentially overriding
    the color of the pulse such as if, say, `pulsar-pulse-line-red` was
    invoked while the `pulsar-face` was blue.

-   Restored several command symbols to the default value of
    `pulsar-pulse-functions`.  Those were disabled to support the use
    option `pulsar-pulse-on-window-change`, but as that is now removed we
    revert to the old and more predictable way of handling things.

-   Introduced conditionality that checks for `real-this-command`.  This
    is necessary for commands that have to fudge `this-command` to provide
    their functionality.  Such is the case with the `evil-scroll-up` and
    `evil-scroll-down` commands which are internally reported as
    `previous-line` and `next-line`, respectively.  I discovered this
    problem while trying to support Duy Nguyen attempts that making
    `pulsar` work with `evil`.
    
    Thanks to Duy Nguyen for reporting the issue on the mailing list and
    then to Tom Dalziel who explained why `evil` does things the way it
    does (it is a good reason):

-   Documented how to use pulsar with the `next-error-hook`.  By default,
    the `n` and `p` keys in Emacs' compilation buffers (e.g. the results
    of a `grep` search) produce a highlight for the locus of the given
    match.  Due to how the code is implemented, we cannot use Pulsar's
    standard mechanism to trigger a pulse after the match is highlighted
    (i.e. by adding the commands to `pulsar-pulse-functions`.  Instead,
    the user must add this to their configuration:
    
        (add-hook 'next-error-hook #'pulsar-pulse-line)

-   Made other miscellaneous changes to tweak the code base and the
    manual.
