In this 30-minute video I philosophise about the notion of letting go.
I do it by discussing the ancient myth of Sisyphos.  Themes I cover:

- The story of Sisyphos in brief and how it is a metaphor.
- Why I think what happens to Sisyphos is not punishment.  He is doing
  it to himself in his ignorance.
- We do not let go of what we treasure the most because we identify
  with it.  We consider it an extension of our self.
- The self is not immutable.  It is not constant.  It changes and does
  everything around us.
- What comes to our possession or, generally, what we associate or
  interact with, does so by coincidence.  We can still not identify
  with it.
- We are like travellers who paths converge only to eventually
  diverge.
- The concept of non-ownership, which I describe with the Greek word
  aktisia (ακτησία).
- How difficult it is to let go as it requires courage and
  magnanimity.
- We can start with small and inconsequential things.  This way we can
  practice and develop the capacity it takes to let go.
- A story about how Atlas, my dogs, has learnt to let go.  We can do
  the same.
