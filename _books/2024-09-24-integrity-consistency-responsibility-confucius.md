In this 45-minute video I talk about the personal qualities of
integrity, consistency, and responsibility. Through various examples,
I explain how they are expressed and what kind of attitude a person
has. There is a personal as well as interpersonal aspect to them. To
help me forward my points, I read through the Analects of Confucius.
This is my second commentary of the sort. The first one was on the
topic of "Action, credibility, and restraint":
