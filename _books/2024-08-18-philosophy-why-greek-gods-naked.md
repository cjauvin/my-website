In this ~50-minute video I talk about the probl√©matique of artistic
nudity in the ancient Greek world and its underlying values. The short
version of what I am saying is that to the Greeks honesty was
important as was excellence. Excellence is a collective achievement,
which I cover at length. Ultimately, the representations we find of
nudity cannot be fully appreciated through a modern, judgemental lens.
The point, then, is for us to be considerate, try to understand the
values of those people---their world-view---and, perhaps, find some
precepts that we can incorporate in our modern lives.
