This is episode 3 of a series I am introducing where I comment on the
book _Dao De Jing_ by Lao Zi.  The present entry covers Chapter 3 of
the book and covers topics of politics, how sages would govern,
whether such arrangements are viable, how our life is one of action
and not theory, how we always need to account for the scope of
application, and the like.
