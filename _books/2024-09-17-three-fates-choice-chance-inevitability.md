In this 28-minute video I talk about a secular understanding of fate.
It consists of three facets, one of which involves our free will. I
explain how our choices condition future choices and possible
outcomes. Then I also discuss the other facets of fate, namely chance
and inevitability, to ultimately talk about a balanced way of
understanding how in our life we have forces outside our control and
things we do affect. It is about recognising how we are powerless in
some ways and empowered to act in others.
