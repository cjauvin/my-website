In this ~40 minute walk I comment on the broad theme of productivity
from the perspective of philosophy.  The main idea is that we cannot
factor out the human involved: every method and tool we use has to
work for us.

What I covered in outline:

* There is no one-size-fits-all that works for all of us.  It is
  important to factor in the subjectivity of the person who will be
  applying the method and using the tools.
* Explanation of my bad experience with "Getting Things Done" (GTD),
  specifically how it was triggering my completionist mode and made me
  feel intimidated by the sheer size of corpus of tasks I had
  accumulated.
* I made the mistake of rationalising my inability to work with GTD as
  me being defective.  Eventually I realised that I was assuming away
  my subjectivity.  I was not inherently broken.  I simply had to find
  methods and tools that work for me.
* One has to be honest about their strengths and weaknesses.  Don't
  try to mimic another person.  Instead experiment until you find what
  is appropriate for you.
* For me the cost of productivity is what I call "austerity".  Namely,
  the recognition that my intellectual curiosity has to be strictly
  moderated so that I do not yield to the temptation of seeking more
  information than I can actually process.
* Accountability structures are arrangements that we design to amplify
  our strengths while minimising our weaknesses.  I have several such
  structures, which I describe in the video.
