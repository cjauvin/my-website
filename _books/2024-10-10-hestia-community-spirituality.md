In this 28-minute video I analyse the archetype of community, both in
respect to its social expression as well as the spiritual one. I
explain what the spirit is and how it relates to the idea of community
with the cosmos. In the process, I discuss the significance in the
symbolism of Greek mythology, with a focus on the goddess Hestia.
