In this ~50 minute video I talk about the theme of doing basic tasks
with consistency. I cover lots of relevant points. In short:

- A relatable story about a smoker who sets an unrealistic target on
  how to change their habits.
- We cannot just set our mind to something and it happens. We have to
  act on it. Deeds matter.
- Without deeds, we do not have anything to build on. We lack the
  capacity.
- We build stuff little by little, including our powers. We know this
  already from our everyday experiences. We do not just bring things
  into being. There is a process.
- My suggestion to help the smoker set an actionable goal. Nothing
  Olympic; nothing fancy.
- What really builds up capacity is consistency.
- I call them "basic powers" because they are not flashy and do not
  capture our attention the way superpowers do.
- Comment on superheroes and how we want superpowers without putting
  in any effort.
- We do not need superpowers. Those are nice for the spectacle but are
  otherwise a distraction.
- What we are toiling against in our everyday life is this tendency of
  ours to let things degrade and to not put in the work to maintain
  them.
- A basic power like consistency goes unnoticed by those who are not
  trained to recognise it. All they see is you doing your tasks. But
  they do not realise how difficult this is.
- To be consistent requires perseverance and this means that it is
  rooted in patience. You acknowledge that whatever it is your are
  doing has a process and that you not being the finished article at
  the outset is part of this process.
- Patience is about having a sense of the here-and-now in light of the
  longer term magnitudes: how you keep the goal in mind while not
  losing track of the immediate issues.
- The desire for the magical solution is not just wrong; it is that it
  serves as a rationalisation of your victimhood and entrapment in
  that state that you do not like. By bringing your ambition to
  something you can actually achieve, you can no longer tell yourself
  how you are trying to quit but cannot do it because the basic goal
  is unreachable.
- The standard has to be tailored to your particularities. There
  cannot be a one-size-fits-all. Find something that works for you;
  the minimum you can accomplish. And do it consistently. Once that
  becomes second nature, then you can increase the intensity.
- Story about the Karate Kid and how the process is about building
  character. Without the requisite character, there is no foundation
  for the specific techniques.
- It ultimately comes down to our wellness; to how we feel about
  ourselves.
- Example of how disorganised I used to be as a young adult and how a
  chaotic life feels disempowering. Minimise your exposure to garbage
  to eliminate the sense of dread from your life: what you experience
  will feel connected to your volition because the work you put in is
  having an impact.
- Comment about the modern pursuit of "being productive" and the
  nonsense of the "10x" employee.
- Comment about not seeking the "second brain" when we should instead
  be trying to maximise the effectiveness of the "first brain" and the
  "first body". Then, even if you do use a second brain/body, you will
  be empowered to use them properly.
- Example of a case where I recommended a basic workflow instead of
  whatever hipster software/method.
- When we are in the flow of doing something, however basic, we (i)
  gain capacity to do it better and (ii) we develop insight into what
  we need to improve. So we learn more about the task at hand as well
  as ourselves. Again, no one-size-fits-all. Discover what works for
  you in particular.
- Comment about wasting our time pursuing the magical solution instead
  of doing something basic in the meantime.
- Remark about how when we are doing something, we have a better sense
  of its difficulty and our ability to cope with it. Whereas when we
  are outsiders to it, we tend to underestimate it while
  overestimating our abilities. Start small and keep doing.
- Note about my creative method, such as in my videos, where I produce
  them in one go with no edits that try to flatter me.
- Comment about the prettification filter of the Internet.
- Story from the time I was a football player about people whose words
  do not match their deeds.
- What goes together with the basic powers is the attitude of not
  saying much; of not talking big.
- This also makes us compassionate, because we know what it takes to
  do something. So when we see another person trying, we do not try to
  bring them done. We say "well done for trying" as we can relate to
  it.
- Basic powers go with basic decency. Treat yourself kindly and the
  best way to do that is to set realisable goals.
- Final thoughts to wrap it all up.
