In this 45-minute video I talk about why I do not use social media. I
explain the experiences I had which made me realise the importance of
real human connections: they make us appreciate people instead of
objectifying them and they allow our opinions to be less extreme. I
then comment how I learnt to put things in order by asking "why" I do
something. This is about personal fulfilment in the immediate sense,
though it extends to more profound interpersonal affairs.
