Another video presentation that I recorded while walking in nature.
You need to watch or listen to the video.  It is about an hour long.

This entry builds on my talk about [meditation, walking, and
acceptance](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-07-meditation-walking-acceptance/).
Though it is no necessary to watch that as well.
