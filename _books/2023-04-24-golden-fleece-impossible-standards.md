In this ~35 minute walk I philosophise about unattainable standards
and unclear desires in our life.  I briefly mention the myth of Jason
and the Argonauts to then draw connections between the insights of
that story and everyday affairs.  What I cover, in short:

- We have a propensity to discount or underappreciate what we have.
  Instead, we have a longing for magical solutions---the golden
  fleece---that will elevate us to great heights.

- We let go of what we have in pursuit of the unattainable.  As we
  fail to attain that, we ultimately feel bad about ourselves,
  rationalising our failure as inadequacy and worthlessness.

- I draw a parallel between the golden fleece and the incessant
  pursuit for the killer app, using Emacs as a case in point.

- When we do not know exactly what we want, we cannot get it.  Even if
  something can read our mind, it still needs to find a mind that is
  clear.  Otherwise we have "garbage in; garbage out."

- Lengthy commentary on impossible standards that govern our life.  I
  explain the scope of application and how we must be aware of it when
  particularising an abstraction.

- I am interested in the multifacetedness of the human condition to
  find precepts that work for humans, not exalted beings.
