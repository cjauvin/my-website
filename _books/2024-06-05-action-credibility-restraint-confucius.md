In this ~50-minute video I read some passages from the Analects of
Confucius and provide my thoughts on them. In overview:

- Avoiding the trap of overthinking. We want to be acting and be
  learning things that we have a use for.
- How to do things in earnest and try to be the best version of
  yourself.
- What it means to be the embodiment of your values, instead of merely
  advertising what you believe in.
- Comments on honour and credibility.
