In this 35-minute video, I talk about my method of creativity. Its
name comes from the history of painting. I explain how I reached the
conclusion that this method is good for me by discussing my experience
at an office job where I was trying to plan ahead of time for
everything. Then I discuss how "alla prima" works with painting but
also with any creative process that involves being "in the flow".
Finally, I describe the merits of this method and how it makes me be
highly productive but also relaxed and happy with myself.
