This is another talk on philosophy.  I recorded it while hiking.  The
main points are:

- A consideration of the practical aspects of my philosophy, such as
  the unity between mind and body (talking and breathing, walking,
  etc.).
- Honesty and introspection are the basics of philosophy.  We start
  doing philosophy when we develop an awareness of what we do
  (mindfulness).
- A case study on dating.  Being honest about our humanity helps us
  avoid the trap of being disappointed the whole time.
- How honesty helps us overcome our ego and be more considerate,
  empathetic persons.
- I understand why one is sceptical about the practicality of
  philosophy because (1) it is broad in scope and (2) there is a
  communication problem, including the pretentiousness of certain
  intellectuals.
