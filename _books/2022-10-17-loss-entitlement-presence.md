Thanks to Dmitry Matveyev for the 500 EUR donation that allowed me to
buy the smartphone (Samsung A53) and selfie stick that I use to record
these videos in the great outdoors.

In this entry, I walked in the mountains and talked about developing
the right attitude for dealing with matters we do not control.  The
main points:

- A story of mine about remaining open to new experiences after
  misfortune strikes.
- You do not control all the factors.  If you assume the blame, you
  imply that you do control those factors.
- If you think you are a god, you will always overestimate your
  abilities.  You will then desire to achieve that which you cannot.
  The disconnect will make you suffer.
- An explanation of non-ownership with specific examples.
- Elaboration on the bad habit of dithering, delaying, and postponing.
  You think you control time, again overestimating yourself.
- Overthinking and overanalysing is to your detriment.  Fundamentally,
  you make the mistake of assuming that the perfect is attainable.
- Thinking that the perfect is attainable means that you expect your
  actions to be perfect.  But to act is to do so in imperfect
  circumstances, with incomplete knowledge.
- To act is to perform a leap of faith.  There is faith in acting.
- More examples that tie it all together.
