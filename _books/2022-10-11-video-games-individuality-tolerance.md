Here is another philosophical talk I did while being outdoors.  You
need to load the video as there is no transcript.  It is about an hour
long.

The main points are:

- I am not judgemental and do not issue edicts or rant about the state
  of the world.  Everything I say is a suggestion; an appeal to your
  reason.
- I am okay with video games.  There is nothing inherently wrong about
  them.
- There exist problems which have to do with business practices.  We
  have those in all industries.
- Whatever your hobbies or activities, try to find a balance in your
  life.  It makes you more rounded and you can understand others
  better.
- When we all try to keep an open mind, we have a more harmonious
  society.  We communicate better and avoid the extremes.
- I am a regular person.  Try not to assume too many things about me
  or anyone.  It helps with maintaining the right disposition and
  being tolerant of the diversity of humans.
