This is episode 2 of a series I am introducing where I comment on the
book _Dao De Jing_ by Lao Zi.  The present entry covers Chapter 2 of
the book and is concerned with understanding the extremes and
interconnectedness, dealing with uncertainty, maintaining the right
disposition in life, and behaving in moderation.

The previous episode is "Comments on Dao #1":
