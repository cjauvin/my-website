This is another video of mine where I do philosophy.  There is no
transcript.  The part with the waterfall starts after the 15:00 mark.
I noticed that whenever I toggled between the front and rear cameras,
there was an interruption or distortion to the audio.  I think nothing
critical is lost, though I will try to find ways to improve this while
still keeping it recording in one go.

Some of the other videos of mine that I mention here:

- [On meditation, walking, and acceptance](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-07-meditation-walking-acceptance/)
- [On self-importance and elitism](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-09-self-importance-elitism/)
- [Practicality, honesty, and patience](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-13-practicality-honesty-patience/)

The main points I covered:

- There is a distinction between showing off and demonstrating
  something, but in practice it is hard to draw clear lines.
- I am an Internet stranger to you (and you to me), which means that
  you have no means of verifying my claims.  This adds to the problem
  with the unclear lines.
- In turn, I cannot control how you perceive of what I consider
  "demonstration"---you may still think it is me "showing off".
- Explanation of the perils of overthinking.
- My corpus of work is---this video of me walking and talking---is a
  demonstration against overthinking.  It proves that I managed to
  overcome a major problem I had.
