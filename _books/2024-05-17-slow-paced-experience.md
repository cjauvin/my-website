In this ~42-minute video I comment on the topic of doing things with
intent and presence. I also switch to the rear camera of my phone to
provide a first-person perspective of my hike.

Some of the highlights:

- The slow-paced experience is juxtaposed with and contrasted to the
  fast-paced life we have. The rhythms of the workplace, the news
  cycle, the pace of social media keep stimulating us but we are not a
  participant in their world.
- It is too fast. We are disempowered because what we do is a mile
  long but only a millimetre thick. There is no depth to it, as we are
  forced to shift our attention to something else.
- Story about me not listening to background music anymore. I also
  wrote a journal entry on the matter about the "music all around":
  https://protesilaos.com/commentary/2024-04-12-the-music-all-around/.
- Why I wanted to do things with intent, to be more intentful with my
  choices. To be a participant instead of a spectator in my subjective
  reality; to feel that I am doing something that has meaning for me,
  even if it does not matter in the grand scheme of things.
- Instead of trying to multi-task, I focus on what I have given my
  attention to. I do it with intent and commitment.
- How I want my sensations to be consistent with my immediate
  environment. Paying attention to things makes me feel I am a member
  of my world.
- Other relatable stories about events that made me think critically
  of the fast-paced life I was living.
- How the slow-paced experience allows me to do things without feeling
  burdened by them.
