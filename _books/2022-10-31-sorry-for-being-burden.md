I hiked and talked philosophy for a bit more than an hour.  I covered
a broad set of topics related to the expression "sorry for being a
burden".  An overview:

* We start feeling like a burden when we are coping with some
  difficult situation.  We think that others are doing well, while we
  are not.
* We do not want to bring others to our misery, so we avoid them.
* Not wanting to externalise our negativity in this way comes from a
  good starting point: we consider the wellness of others.
* An explanation of how this apparent altruism is biased both against
  us and against the others.  We think we are worthless while they are
  impeccable.
* When we think we are a burden, we develop a sense of egocentrism
  even though we do not want to.  We do it by obsessing about our
  condition.
* Our obsession turns into a misplaced sense of exceptionalism as we
  think we are special in our agony: "I am special because I am the
  only one who suffers".
* There is a "transmission mechanism" by which this ostensible burden
  can be distributed.  Explanation of how this relates to the
  communicative aspect of the human condition.
* We cannot opt out of our humanity.  To be sorry for being human is
  pointless.  We always communicate.
* When we communicate with others, we open ourselves to their
  positivity.  In general, we remove the obstacles that worsen our
  condition.
* Explanation of moderation, of finding a middle way between the
  extremes.
* More comments on the perversion of self-hatred that masquerades as
  altruism.
* Practical ways to gradually escape from the overthinking loop.  We
  break the cycle by acting.  Also comment on one's physical condition
  and how idle energy is contributing to the problem.
* We live in a world where we forget to be human sometimes and are
  absorbed in our little bubble---practical step to avoid that.
* Example with how we do not control how others perceive our messages
  and why we should not blame our self or them.
* Don't judge and be patient.
