In this 40+ minute walk I talk about how we think of our self in
relation to things we are familiar with and others that remain unknown
to us.  Fundamentally, the idea is how we rationalise our inhibitions
as the best we could ever get.  The talking points in outline:

* I started thinking about the comfort zone and impostor feelings
  after I received [an award from the Free Software
  Foundation](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-09-01-emacs-fsf-award/)
  for my contributions to Emacs and free software.
* How can someone with my non-technical background make contribute to
  a technical milieu?
* How can someone get out of their comfort zone and basically declare
  in public "hey, I do not actually know this!"?
* The basic idea that helped me overcome my fears is to entertain the
  worst case scenario.  What could possibly go wrong if I am
  incompetent in my technical endeavours?  The answer usually is that
  nothing major will happen and we are misjudging the extent of the
  issue.
* Explanation of the tension that arises between our actual
  imperfections and the pretences on faultlessness that we have.
* At its core, we base our conduct on the lie that we can be something
  other than a human: a fallible being.
* The comfort zone can be a prison cell.  We may be treating the realm
  of the familiar as the realm of the good.
* To escape from that cage is to allow yourself the chance to learn
  more about who you are and what this world has to offer.
* To start working against our inhibitions we must lift the burden of
  perfection from our shoulders.  We admit to our humanity, to our
  actuality, and thus accept that mistakes and omissions are part of
  what we do.
* No-one who has ever said or done anything has been perfect.  No
  expert is omniscient.  If we were to take the view that we need to
  be perfected before doing something, then we will all do nothing.
* Talk about my caricature of the world into introverts and extroverts
  and how that funny yet truthful insight helped me stop overthinking
  my fears.
* Change happens in a stepwise fashion.  We have to take it slow,
  focusing on the immediate task at hand and not worrying about the
  end goal.
* Ultimately, we must put faith in the process.
