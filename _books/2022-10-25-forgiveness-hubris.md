I walked and talked philosophy for an hour.  In this presentation, I
talked about the substance of values, with forgiveness as a case in
point.  To make the topic more relatable, I described what "hubris" is
and offered some concrete examples.

The contents in brief:

- Real story of a person that would not let go of something trivial
  that happened more than 30 years ago.
- Link it to the mistake of appreciating forgiveness or anything
  pertaining to self-improvement only with regard to its ultimate
  rewards.  This also relates to the previous entry [on
  self-improvement](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-21-self-improvement/).
- The practical aspect of forgiveness in the here-and-now is that we
  keep ourselves free from useless burdens, else garbage.  We can then
  focus our limited resources on something more useful.
- Talk about the myth of Sisyphus and how it essentially describes the
  struggles of the person who does not let go.
- Comment on the theme of non-ownership, though it is not the focus
  here.  I talked more about this in [loss, entitlement, and
  presence](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-17-loss-entitlement-presence/).
- Explain another story of me not becoming a priest and how it relates
  to this case.
- Talk about the misplaced ritualistic view we have of certain
  precepts.  Basically, we miss the point as we cater to the
  appearances while disregarding the essential teachings.
