In this ~40-minute video, I talk about matters of love, faith,
justice, and control. I do it by presenting the ancient Greek myth of
Orpheus and Eurydice: a love story with profound insights about the
human condition, interpersonal relations, the importance of faith in
love affairs, and our place in the cosmos.
