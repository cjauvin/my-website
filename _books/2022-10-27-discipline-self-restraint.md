I climbed the mountain and sat at its top, all while talking
philosophy.  This video is about an hour long.  These are the main
themes:

* Story about me when I was younger, which illustrates how I had the
  appearance of discipline without a solid grasp of the "why"
* Continuation of that story, delving into my bad habit with alcohol
  consumption.  The gist is that I overestimated my ability by
  believing in my own narrative of how disciplined I was---a mistake.
* How can we have self-restraint without a good understanding of our
  self and of our limits?
* Discussion on the introspection---the search for the "why"---that
  made me understand the reason I was behaving in that bad way (where
  alcohol was the facilitator and enabler of certain experiences).
* Tie it all together in an exposition about not talking big and not
  overestimating our abilities.
* Comment on three more stories that further explain these and related
  ideas.
* In short: be patient, take it slow, do not assume that you are
  special, do not talk big, have a sense of purpose that is consistent
  with your actuality, put yourself to the test in order to learn who
  you are (what you can and cannot do).
