In this ~35 minute walk I talk about philosophical themes related to
artificial intelligence and our attitudes towards it.  In outline:

* There are similarities between modern attitudes towards AI and how
  ancient folks would treat oracles as authoritative and infallible.
* Story about the Oracle of Apollon in Delphi and how it would provide
  non-answers to questions that could not be reduced to a "yes or no".
* Explanation of how we must think about complexity and what our
  attitude should be towards presumed oracular wisdom.
* Oracles or AI are neither good nor bad.  It depends on how we deal
  with them.  Discussion about being gullible or not.
* Story about Prometheus, the know-how of fire, and whether tools are
  good/bad for us.
* Avoiding extremes by trying to be less presumptuous about our
  capacity for good/evil.
* Switching gears to individuals affairs.  Talk about feelings of
  expertise; of setting goals and accomplishing them.
* There is value to be had in mastery, in not copy-pasting answers,
  but in actually understanding things in-depth.
* Talk about how prior notes/work frames and limits our creativity.
  AI can do the same if we get in the bad habit of not putting in the
  hard work.
* Connection between these insights and what I covered at length in my
  presentation about "productivity, honesty, and accountability
  structures":
  <https://protesilaos.com/books/2023-02-21-productivity-honesty-accountability-structures/>.
* Do not underestimate your potential and how you can feel inexorable
  when you put in the effort.
