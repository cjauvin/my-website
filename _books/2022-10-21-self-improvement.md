In this entry, I scaled a mountain to make a philosophical point
pertinent to the titular topic.  This talk is a bit less than an hour
long.  The main ideas:

* We sometimes think of self-improvement only as a means to an
  ulterior goal, such as money, fame, sex.
* Use the example of climbing to the top of the mountain in hope of
  finding those "rewards".
* Elaborate on the connection between the transactional view of
  self-improvement and the concept of entitlement.  The latter was
  also covered in my previous talk about [loss, entitlement, and
  presence](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-17-loss-entitlement-presence/).
* Explain that self-importance is okay but how it can go awry.  A
  relevant theme was covered in my talk about [On self-importance and
  elitism](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-09-self-importance-elitism/).
* Discuss how philosophy helps us overcome the self-centric view.  We
  do not expect rewards.
* Talk about expectations and entitlement, with a view to how they can
  make a person turn their disappointment into a weapon that is used
  against others.
* Remark how philosophy helps us remain calm and not go to extremes.
