In this ~30 minute walk, I talk about philosophical themes related to
the hut I built in the mountains of Cyprus.  These are lessons for
life:

* Past choices frame future options, meaning that even if we have
  perfectly free will, we still operate within confines that cannot be
  undone.
* There are moments where we must rise to the occasion, effectively
  becoming someone we were not.  Never underestimate someone who has
  no other choice but to fight.
* The prevailing conditions make the person.  They compel one into
  action.
* Mental fortitude depends on one's patience and understanding of the
  bigger picture.  It is about how one can preserve their unflinching
  commitment to the cause.
* Story about mental fortitude and the ancient Spartans.
* Commentary on the subjectivity of experiences and the illusion of
  factual objectivity.
* Why narratives matter to us in our everyday life and why our outlook
  is important.
* Faith is inescapable.  We rely on beliefs to cover for the imperfect
  information at our disposal as well as our lack of perfect insight.
