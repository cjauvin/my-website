In this ~50-minute video I talk about the philosophical theme of
diversity with masculinity as a case in point. Some of the main
points:

- How art captures patterns of everyday behaviour to turn them into
  archetypes. Those help us understand profound insights in a
  relatable way.
- Discussion about the archetype of Achilles: the champion who fought
  in the Trojan War (reference to the relevant art).
- How Achilles is as relevant as ever with regard to discourses about
  masculinity and how men "should" be.
- We can find the Achilles type in the form of the influencer who
  prompts his audience to be forceful.
- Why exceptional skills do not justify one being arrogant and
  intolerant towards others.
- Achilles is not the only type of man. Even within a single gender,
  there are many types.
- The case of Odysseus, another hero of the Trojan War, and how there
  can be different types of man.
- How modern-day narratives discount the diversity even within a
  single gender. This encourages once group of men to bully other men.
- Comments on how Odysseus differs from Achilles in terms of dealing
  with challenges. Sometimes you do not just power through; sometimes
  you have to work around.
- The case of Odysseus and the Cyclops. This is an example of not
  trying to solve everything with brute force, as that is foolish.
- There is nothing wrong with being strong. The problem is when we are
  trying to create a monoculture among men.
- Instead of recognising how things stand, we are quick to judge them.
- I don't think there is anything wrong with some elements of advice,
  such as exercising. But if we make that the be-all-end-all of
  manhood, there starts the problem. It breeds intolerance towards the
  fact that there are other activities as well; other types of man.
- Personal stories where men try to play tough.
- How being pretentious is bad for you and your relationships.
- Connecting the dots in all the aforementioned.
- Explaining discipline as opposed to obedience and conformity.
- The archetype of Athena, the goddess of wisdom, and what it
  symbolises.
