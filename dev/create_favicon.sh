# Description {{{
# ---------------
#
# This script generates a favicon.ico and places it at the root of the
# project's directory.  Web browsers can pick up that file even without
# being told to do so in the HTML head.
#
# To generate the favicon.ico, this script will first create a set of
# smaller .png files from a base image.  It will then optimise and
# combine them into the end product.
#
# Debian Buster dependencies:
#
# 	apt install git imagemagick optipng
#
# This script is part of a broader effort to remove nodejs from my
# workflow when developing my website.
#
# My site and its source code:
# * https://protesilaos.com/
# * https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/protesilaos.gitlab.io
