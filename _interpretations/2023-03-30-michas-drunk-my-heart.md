title: "Interpretation of “You're drunk my heart” by Giorgos Michas"
excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a song whose translated title is 'You're drunk, my heart'."

I discovered this song today and felt the need to write about it:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6miQPiY7Z8>.

Below are the original lyrics, my translation of them, and some
philosophical comments.

```
Μέθυσες καρδιά μου

Ερμηνεία:  Γιώργος Μίχας
Στίχοι:    Γιώργος Μίχας
Μουσική:   Γιώργος Μίχας


Χάρτινες βαρκούλες τα κορμιά
θάλασσες δεμένες με σκοινιά
νύχτες που λικνίζονται μες στο φως
κι ο ουρανός τους λάσπη και βυθός

Σκόνη οι μέρες κι ο άνεμος θρασύς
πόσο να πεθάνεις αν δεν ζεις
Κρύφτηκε η φλόγα στο ψυγείο
κι ο έρωτας χτυπιέται στο φορείο

Μέθυσες καρδιά μου απ' το κενό
τόσοι σε κοιτούν αλλά σε βλέπω μόνο εγώ
Δυο ευθείες παράλληλες εμείς
κι όμως θα συναντηθούμε αν το πιστέψεις

αν το πεις

Πέτρωσε η φωνή στην άρνησή σου
κι οι ρουφιάνοι όλοι ήτανε μαζί σου
Η χαρά μια χώρα που ποτέ δε βρήκα
η αγάπη σα κεντρί από μια σφήκα

τρελαμένα τα ανθρωπάκια πάνω κάτω
θα γαμήσουνε το σύμπαν για ένα πιάτο
Θα χορέψουν θα γελάσουν λυσσασμένα
και δεκάρα δεν θα δώσουνε για σένα

Μέθυσες καρδιά μου απ' το κενό
τόσοι σε κοιτούν αλλά σε βλέπω μόνο εγώ
Δυο ευθείες παράλληλες εμείς
κι όμως θα συναντηθούμε αν το πιστέψεις

αν το πεις
```

You're drunk my heart

Performance:  Giorgos Michas
Lyrics:       Giorgos Michas
Music:        Giorgos Michas


Paper boats are the bodies
seas tied with ropes
nights that oscillate in the light
and their sky mud and depths

Dust are the days and the wind rude
how much can you die if you are not alive
The fire hid in the fridge
and love at first sight gets hit on the stretcher

You're drunk my heart by the void
so many stare at you though only I see you
Two straight parallels are we
yet we will meet if you believe it

if you say it

The voice petrified by your refusal
and the ruffians were all there beside you
Happiness is a land I did not find
and love is like the sting of the bumblebee

Maddened the petty humans up and down
they'll fuck the universe for a dish
they'll dance, they'll smile rabidly
and won't give a penny about you

You're drunk my heart by the void
so many stare you though only I see you
Two straight parallels are we
yet we will meet if you believe it

if you say it
```

What I like about _You're drunk my heart_ is its authenticity and the
simplicity therein.  I get the sense that Giorgos is not merely
voicing those lyrics, but is reliving memories, sharing with us the
distillation of the accumulated knowledge.

To liken bodies to boats made out of paper is to acknowledge the fact
that we are all breakable.  We do remain afloat, though barely so.
The metaphor also speaks to our lack of control in the grand scheme of
things.  We are the product of events beyond our control;
circumstances that contribute to our presence yet remain outside the
scope of our volition.  To think we can choose whatever we want is to
conflate situational privilege with general actuality.  It burdens us
and sets us up for failure by inducing a false sense of guilt and
worthlessness.

Yet our powerlessness is only rendered clear in juxtaposition to the
Cosmos.  In our immediate affairs, we are capable of great deeds;
deeds that every hitherto establishment is bent on exploiting.  The
hubris of deranged tyrants rests in the belief that the sea can indeed
be enslaved.  Such is the human potential that it will find the means
to undo whatever panopticon.  Though here too, we are basically saying
the same thing: we are not in control of our creativity either.  We do
not get to choose our talents, inclinations, and dispositions.  What
we get is yet another paper boat.  It floats and may go somewhere,
though its captain still cannot chart whatever course on a whimsy.

Giorgos asks "how much can you die if you are not alive".  While I can
relate to that sentiment, I think we always have something to lose,
even when we feel long dead inside.  We prefer certain outcomes over
others, the company of our pet over solitude, singing over silence.
We can only be content when we accept what we get, the way it is, for
as long as it is.  Start enumerating everything you missed: a lifetime
will not be enough to compile such a list.  We die more with each new
unfulfilled desire.  It was a stare, it was a smile, it is no more.
Let go!

Happiness is a land we cannot visit because there is no refuge for
those who seek that which is landless.  Dreams can take us far and
wide, to explore enchanted groves, partake in the rituals of mages,
and behold the crimson moons.  Yet none of those wonders can sate our
appetite for more.  Instead of being thankful for bearing witness to
new possibilities, we ask for another round and, ultimately, beg for
the overdose.  Acceptance is what underpins restraint.

We do not recognise our paper boat reality, blithely leaving
destruction in our wake.  The average person does not admit to their
transient presence on this patch of earth.  There was a before and
there will be an after.  We believe we can get away with our
profligacy.  The gods will happily let humanity find its demise.  When
the reason we are endowed with is apparently failing to deter us, some
greater force will.

The heart of the sensitive person is overwhelmed by all this, yet few
can figure as much.  The "how are you?" meets an eager "fine,
thanks!", followed by a smile.  There is enough trouble already.  Yet
marginalisation, even with altruistic intentions, comes with the
latent risk of twisting the perception of the person into thinking
they are somehow better or worse than the rest.  Such is the state of
drunkenness.  Sometimes the stares and the smiles must last a little
longer.

I think Giorgos has done a remarkable job with _You're drunk my
heart_.  Art shows us the power of honesty while the artist reminds us
that wisdom does not come ex officio.
