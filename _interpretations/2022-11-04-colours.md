title: "Colours (my poem)"
excerpt: "Poetry on contrasting times."

Here is just another poem of mine.  The second I ever wrote.  As with
[Olives](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2022-11-03-olives/),
I composed it in one go and did not tend to its aesthetic appeal.  It
is authentic me.

```
Blue or green
memento of a Summer gone

Black or grey
reminder of sweet delusion
```
