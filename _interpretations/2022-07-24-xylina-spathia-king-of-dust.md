excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a song whose translated title is 'The king of dust'."
---

Τα Ξύλινα Σπαθιά (Ta Xylina Spathia, which means "The Wooden Swords") is
an old Greek rock band that I have covered before: [Interpretation of
“At the rock” by Xylina Spathia](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2022-07-05-xylina-spathia-on-the-rock/).

For this entry, I have picked to translate and provide philosophical
commentary on a classic: "The king of dust" (Ο βασιλιάς της σκόνης).  It
sounds good even if you don't get the lyrics, while it has something
profound to teach us: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBabLCTXUxs> (not
an official video as the band predates this era).

Here is a link to an official recording, performed by then lead singer
of Xylina Spathia and now solo artist Pavlos Pavlides (plus B - movies):

Below are the original lyrics, my translation of them, and my
comments.

```
Ο βασιλιάς της σκόνης

Εγώ ο μικρός, ο αμνός του Θεού
ξεχασμένος στο Νότο, γεννημένος αλλού
Ξέρω πάντα η Τροία θα 'ναι μίλια μακριά
κι η Ωραία Ελένη θα 'ναι τώρα γριά

Βγαίνω στο δρόμο ορκισμένος να μπω
στα παλάτια του ήλιου, να μπορέσω να πω
το τραγούδι του τράγου με φωνή φονική
και να κλάψω μετά, να χαθώ στη σιωπή

Ο βασιλιάς της σκόνης

Θα περάσουν τα χρόνια, θα γυρίσει ο τροχός
όλα θα 'ναι σαν πρώτα, όλα θα 'ναι αλλιώς
Θα σε ψάχνω στους δρόμους που γυρνούσες, μα εσύ
θα 'χεις γίνει σκιά, θα 'χουν όλα χαθεί

Ένα βράδυ θα φέγγει το φεγγάρι τρελό
Θ' απλωθεί η σκιά σου σ' ένα δρόμο στενό
Τα ταξίδια, οι φίλοι, οι αγκαλιές, τα φιλιά
σ' ένα κόσμο θαμπό μακριά, μακριά

Ο βασιλιάς της σκόνης

Από του δράκου τη χρόνια, περάσαν χρόνια
τώρα μπορεί να μη θυμάσαι τίποτα
αλλά η ρόδα της ζωής γυρνά αιώνια
και μόλις λιώσουνε τα χιόνια
να 'ρθεις να με βρεις

Ο βασιλιάς της σκόνης
```

The king of dust

I the small, the lamb of God
forgotten in the South, born elsewhere
I know Troy will always be miles away
and Beautiful Helen (aka "Helen of Troy") will now be old

I venture on the road sworn to enter
the palaces of sun, to be able to sing
the song of the goat (literally the ode of the goat, i.e. "tragedy") with a killer voice
and cry afterwards, get lost in the silence

The king of dust

Years will go by, the wheel will spin
everything will be like before, everything will be different
I'll be searching in the streets you wandered, but you
will have become a shadow, all will be lost

One night the moon will shine madly
Your shadow will cover a narrow street
The travels, the friends, the hugs, the kisses
in a hazy world afar, afar

The king of dust

Since the year of the dragon, ages have gone by
now you may not remember a thing
yet the wheel of life spins eternally
and as soon as the snow melts
come find me

The king of dust
```

Who is the king of dust?  What is the poet trying to communicate?  My
impression is that the king of dust is every possible king, emperor,
supreme leader, et cetera.  It also is every one of those who thinks
they possess something.  The song is a comment on the theme of
non-ownership, which I covered before: [Interpretation of “Bells” by
Lhasa de Sela](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2022-07-12-lhasa-bells/).

We think we own stuff.  Our possessions, our holdings, our loved ones,
our self.  Yet everything is alienable.  Everything can be stripped
away.  There is nothing we can hold on to.  At best, we die with it.

The song starts by describing the exuberance of youth and its lack of
perspective.  The fearless fellow who goes on an adventure and will stop
at nothing.  Here Helen symbolises the pretexts we have, just as in the
legend of the Trojan War (Homer's _Iliad_).  No decade-long war was
fought over the beauty of a woman.  This is the poet's way of showing
how we come up with excuses and rationalisations.  (Modern wars have
such "Helens", but let's not disturb those who blithely believe
otherwise.)

Helen also represents the unattainable dream.  Much like how the
Achaeans went to war to restore their honour and bring Beautiful Helen
back home.  Helen is a tragic figure because she is known for her
beauty---for something she purportedly has---even though beauty is
ephemeral.  No matter how good one looks, the years will take their toll
on them.  This too is a note on the topic of non-ownership: Helen is a
queen of dust, although she is not recognised as such.  We do not own
what appears to be "our" beauty.  It comes and goes.  Pretend otherwise.

This youth, this poetic "I", enters the palaces of the sun to basically
claim a right to some kind of ownership.  Yet the youth leaves the place
crying, with nothing left to say.  These palaces are, in my reading, a
symbol for the truth.  They represent enlightenment.  We want to cling
on to what we think is rightfully ours, yet the truth is that nothing is
ours and there is no right of such a sort.  Some are not ready for the
truth: their whole world collapses.  The least prepared are those who
act out of enthusiasm and believe that elderly Helen is still the famed
beauty of yester years.

Our hero learns about the fact of non-ownership and eventually comes to
terms with it.  The "I" will still reminisce about past experiences,
even though it knows those are not present and only exist in a distant,
hazy world: the past.  These are not disturbing.  They do not evoke
sadness, for there is an understanding that they cannot be acquired.  It
is the desire to the contrary that harms us, the expectation of
ownership, the falsehood of---and misplaced belief in---permanence.

The king of dust admits to the incessant change of the cosmos.
Everything is in a state of flux: the wheel keeps spinning,
ever-transfiguring the presences.

The king of dust, in the realisation of being a king of dust, remains
tranquil.  The right perspective consists in acceptance, in recognising
how things stand, which begets calmness.  The upside is that we exist in
the present.  We can experience new moments.  This is my reading of how
the song ends: forget about the past, come find me, and let's live in
the here-and-now.

[ Somewhat relevant: [Interpretation of “Kiss” by Michelle
Gurevich](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2022-07-16-gurevich-kiss/)
]

The king of dust is tranquil in the knowledge that one cannot lose
anything because one owns nothing.  There is a lightness to this
mindset, a sense of relief, which frees us from the fetters of false
worries and concerns.
