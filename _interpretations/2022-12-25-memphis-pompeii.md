title: "Interpretation of “Pompeii” by Memphis (Μ3ΜΦ1Σ)"
excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a Greek song whose translated title is 'Pompeii'."
---

For this entry, I am picking a song from Memphis (stylised as
"Μ3ΜΦ1Σ"), one of my favourite contemporary rock bands.  It is titled
after the historical city of Pompeii and draws inspiration from the
volcanic eruption that led to Pompeii's burial under several meters of
lava: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tfWxOEWIzM> (also check their
Bandcamp page for their entire discography:
<https://m3mf1s.bandcamp.com/music>)

Below are its original lyrics in Greek, my translation, and subsequent
philosophical commentary.  Note that I have covered Memphis before:

Πομπηία

Άνοιξε η γη κι η τελευταία μας πνοή
σαν μουσική μες στους δρόμους αντηχεί
Και η συμφορά κατά πάνω μας ορμά
λυτρωτικά, ένα βήμα την φορά

θα μας βρουν κοντά
μες στην λαβα που κυλά
μεσ' στην στάχτη, στην φωτιά

Φίλα με αργά
η Πομπηία επάνω μας
θα πέφτει και θα μας κρατά

Άρχισε η γιορτή, η τελευταία μας σιγή
Διστακτικά, πριν περάσουν τα μισά
ξαναμετρά, ένα βήμα την φορά
```

```
Pompeii

The earth has opened and our last breath
like music echoes in the streets
And calamity rushes towards us
as salvation, one step at a time

They will find us nearby
in the lava that flows
in the ash, in the fire

Kiss me slowly
Pompeii will be falling upon us
and will be holding us

The festival has started, our last silence
Cautiously, before the half is over
it counts again, one step at a time
```

The ancient city of Pompeii was a prospering city that was wiped off
the face of the earth by a volcanic eruption.  One moment it was
there, the next it was no more.  Just like that!

Poetically, this event reminds us of our powerlessness against the
forces of nature.  Our presence hinges on a delicate balance of
multiple factors that we do not control.  People can interpret such
phenomena as the manifestation of a god's wrath.  We have this
intuition that the world revolves around us, so something terrible on
that scale must mean that we erred lamentably.  The specifics vary
depending on the culture, though the central theme is one of _desert_
(as in _deserve_), of reward and punishment.

We seek an explanation to catastrophes that answers the underlying
"why".  In the absence of definitive proof, we formulate hypotheses
and attribute this outcome to the workings of a greater power whose
machinations we do not understand.  All this is plausible and worth
considering.  An alternative theory is that things happen despite us
and we are simply caught in the middle.  In this case, there is no
grand plan with us as its protagonists or main victims, but the
ordinary workings of a greater system of which we are but a tiny
factor.

[On the meaning and purpose of life](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-11-02-meaning-purpose-life/) ]

In their song, Memphis deliver what I consider an encouraging message:
presence, the virtue of focusing on the here-and-now.  It is easy to
interpret this powerlessness of ours in a way that deprives us of our
willingness to live or appreciate what we have.  We may wonder what
the point is, anyway, and in the process reason ourselves into
depression.

[ Watch: [Loss, entitlement, and presence](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-17-loss-entitlement-presence/) ]

To ask your lover to kiss you while your shared world collapses all
around you is to say that _this_ is beautiful, _this_ is nice, _this_
is meaningful to us, regardless of the before and the after.  The
moment is not beautiful due to its ever-lasting duration.  No, we know
moments fly by and, generally, we are transient.  The moment is not
worthwhile as an intermediate step to some greater reward.  No, we can
like something in itself, plus we never know for sure what our future
has in store of us.  By focusing on the event, we find meaning in the
little things that our humanity is attuned to.

Presence helps us overcome existential fears and insecurities that we
have.  Why are we here?  What is the purpose of all this?  With
presence, we learn to trust in our devices and to follow all those
hints that our nature has scattered all around for inquisitive folks
to make something out of what they have been endowed with.  By being
present, we learn to enjoy the journey while acknowledging our
ignorance; ignorance which also applies to the fact that we do not
know what the destination is.

In the end, we all die.  The healthy and the sickly; the sober and the
drunks.  Everyone!  With presence, we learn to appreciate what we
have, in the way that we do, and for as long as we do.  If there
exists some other world where we still operate as human, some
destination worth reaching, it will also be an ever-present
experience, given our humanity.

Learn to kiss like there is no tomorrow.  Kiss as if Pompeii is
collapsing upon you.  It happens here; it happens now.
