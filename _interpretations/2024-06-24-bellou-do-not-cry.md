excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a Greek song whose translated title is 'Do not cry'."

In this entry, I translate a beloved Greek song from the 1980s and
provide further commentary on its lyrics:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umzN2ujyARY>. Below are the original
lyrics followed by my translation.

```
Ερμηνεία: Σωτηρία Μπέλλου
Μουσική:  Ηλίας Ανδριόπουλος
Στίχοι:   Μιχάλης Μπουρμπούλης

Μη κλαις και μη λυπάσαι που βραδιάζει
Εμείς που ζήσαμε φτωχοί
Του κόσμου η βροχή δε μας πειράζει
Εμείς που ζούμε μοναχοί

Τα σπίτια είναι χαμηλά
σαν έρημοι στρατώνες
Τα καλοκαίρια μας μικρά
κι ατέλειωτοι οι χειμώνες

Μη κλαις και μη φοβάσαι το σκοτάδι
Εμείς που ζήσαμε φτωχοί
Του κόσμου η απονιά δε μας τρομάζει
Θα έρθει και για μας μια Κυριακή

Τα σπίτια είναι χαμηλά
σαν έρημοι στρατώνες
Τα καλοκαίρια μας μικρά
κι ατέλειωτοι οι χειμώνες
```

```
Performance:  Sotiria Bellou
Lyrics:       Elias Andriopoulos
Music:        Michalis Bourboulis

Do not cry and do not be sad that it darkens
We who lived poor
The world's rain does not bother us
We who live alone

The houses are short
like deserted barracks
Our summers are brief
and our winters endless

Do not cry and do not fear the darkness
We who lived poor
The world's indifference does not scare us
There will come for us a Sunday

The houses are short
like deserted barracks
Our summers are brief
and our winters endless
```

_Do not cry_ speaks of everyday hardship of the sort only poverty
creates. It is about those quotidian affairs you cannot experience
because they are priced out of your budget. One can relate to the
humiliation a person feels when their worth is measured in terms of
money; when their many talents are cast aside on the basis of their
low income.

There is no contempt in those lyrics. They describe a tough life in a
manner that is courageous and optimistic. The poor people need not
lose their greatest social quality: honour. They must not use their
immiseration as an excuse for debasing their moral standing. Instead,
they can muster the strength to continue on with life, showing a
positive attitude, being helpful towards their comrades, and leading
by example.

There is a certain beauty in being poor. You do not feel entitled to
anything in this world as you learn to appreciate the little things
and to work with what you have. If you have to sleep on the floor
because the inflatable bed is broken, you do it without complaints.
Every moment is precious and you can only be thankful to have
experienced it. It is not the overseas trips, the opulent decor, and
extravagant nights out that provide the sole conduit to fulfilment.
You can just enjoy the gentle breeze and the ambient noise of the
cicadas during those "brief summers".

Wealth is not inherently evil, though it easily distorts a person's
and society's sense of place. When everything a petulant child wants
is readily available, it is hard for it---be it as a kid or adult---to
ever relate to the life of a person who has to toil day and night,
with unpaid overtime shifts, just to acquire the essentials. The
feeling of plenty and of its concomitant immediacy disconnects a
person from the natural rhythms of the Earth Mother, the seasonality
of crops, and the general fact that everything must run its course
before it is ready. One shall never have patience when everything they
ever desire is delivered to them right away.

You need not fear the darkness when your values are clear. The
circumstances delineate the horizon of possibilities in any given
state of affairs, yet they do not necessarily undo a person's outlook.
Let there be incessant rain: we will tolerate being wet.
