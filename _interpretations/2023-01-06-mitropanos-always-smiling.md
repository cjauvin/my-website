title: "Interpretation of “Always smiling” by Dimitris Mitropanos"
excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a Greek song whose translated title is 'Always smiling'."
---

For this entry I have picked one of my favourite songs from Greece's
_laiko_ (_λαϊκό_ meaning "popular") genre, performed by the inimitable
Dimitris Mitropanos (Δημήτρης Μητροπάνος).  _Always smiling_ has the
instrumentation of the powerful _zeibekiko_ style and the lyrical
profundity we typically encounter in the alternative rock scene:

Below are the lyrics in Greek, my translation of them, and relevant
philosophical commentary.

```
Πάντα γελαστοί

Εμηνεία:  Δημήτρης Μητροπάνος
Στίχοι:   Άλκης Αλκαίος
Μουσική:  Θάνος Μικρούτσικος


Της νύχτας οι αμαρτωλοί και της αυγής οι μόνοι
θέλουν βαρύ ζεϊμπέκικο και νευρικό τιμόνι
Σε τόπους τριγυρίζουνε, σβησμένους απ' το χάρτη
για μια σταγόνα ουρανό, για μιαν αγάπη σκάρτη

Όσοι με το Χάρο γίναν φίλοι
με τσιγάρο φεύγουνε στα χείλη
στα τρελά τους όνειρα δοσμένοι
πάντα γελαστοί, πάντα γελαστοί
πάντα γελαστοί και γελασμένοι

Τα νιάτα μας διαδρομή Αθήνα-Σαλονίκη
μια πόλη χτίσαμε μαζί κι ακόμα ζω στο νοίκι
Έπεσα να σ' ονειρευτώ σε ψάθα από φιλύρα
κι είδα πως βγάζει η νύχτα φως και τ' όστρακο πορφύρα

Όσοι με το Χάρο γίναν φίλοι
με τσιγάρο φεύγουνε στα χείλη
στα τρελά τους όνειρα δοσμένοι
πάντα γελαστοί, πάντα γελαστοί
πάντα γελαστοί και γελασμένοι
```

Always smiling

Singer:  Dimitris Mitropanos
Lyrics:  Alkis Alkaios
Music:   Thanos Mikroutsikos


The night's sinful and the dawn's lonely
need heavy zeibekiko and angry wheel
In places they wander, faded from the map
for a drop of sky, for an obsolete love

Those who befriended Charon [loosely "Death"]
leave with a cigarette on the lips
given to their crazy dreams
always smiling, always smiling
always smiling and beguiled

Our youth a trip from Athens to Salonica [Thessaloniki]
We built a city together and I still live on rent
I slept to dream of you on mats of lime tree
and saw how the night produces light and the shell porphyry [deep purple]

Those who befriended Charon
leave with a cigarette on the lips
given to their crazy dreams
always smiling, always smiling
always smiling and beguiled
```

Let's start with the unknown word in the first stanza: _zeibekiko_.
This is a type of dance that would historically be performed by a
drunk late at night or in the early morning hours.  The dance is
supposed to express one's frustration and sorrow.  It is not a
stylistic dance and should, conceptually, look drunken and feel
spontaneous.  In modern days, zeibekiko is taught in dance schools as
a type of ballet for dummies: it has a lightness to it that does not
capture the complex mental state of the original.  The "heavy
zeibekiko", then, encapsulates one's justified, even if poorly
expressed, indignation with the state of their life and the world
at-large.

Those who perform such a dance, the titular protagonists who always
smile, are the stray souls of our society.  They have no credentials,
no accolades to pamper their social standing.  Misfits who cannot
tolerate the odious conditions they labour in and who would rather
traverse uncharted territories as lonely wolves than be someone's
inert lapdog.  The "drop of sky" symbolises the modicum of freedom
such souls live for: a love affair that is rendered obsolete by an
unjust establishment predicated on the control of human by human.

Such control is made manifest in the political realities of our
quotidian life, where our work and the wealth of the globe in general
is appropriated by a tiny minority.  Inequality is not an intermediate
side-effect on some inexorable path towards economic optimality.  It
rather is the innate propensity of a system of interventionism that is
[designed to prop up a
demistate](https://protesilaos.com/politics/2021-05-29-nation-state-democracy-transnationalism/)
that privatises profits while socialising debts.  We labour for long
hours, "building a city together", only to have the overlords threaten
us with immiseration and homelessness.

To befriend death is to not tolerate the hubris of this order; to
point at the fact that no euphemism, no amount of polish, can obscure
its cruelty.

The smiling ones are dead inside.  Alas!  They always smile because
they responded to hypocrisy with honesty, knowing that it was the
right course of action despite the losses they incurred in the form of
social marginalisation.  While noble in their disposition, the smiling
ones are beguiled in thinking that one's martyrdom can suffice.  It
might give the impetus for thoroughgoing reform, though concerted and
sustained action is required; action which rests on the conservation
of all available forces, as no-one is expendable.

It is fine to be a dreamer and to die alone in the middle of nowhere.
Know, though, that more will find the same gruesome fate unless
someone sets a new paradigm by no longer being the smiling one.  It is
about channelling one's vitality towards the kind of cause that
ensures we live freely amid the superstructures that environ and
condition our collective experience.  This requires responsibility and
a sober mind instead of a daredevil's reckless appeals to Death.
