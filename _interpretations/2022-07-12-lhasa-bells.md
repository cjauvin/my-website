title: "Interpretation of “Bells” by Lhasa de Sela"
excerpt: "My philosophical commentary on a song titled 'Bells', by Lhasa de Sela."
---

Unlike my previous entries in [this
series](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations), today I will not
translate a Greek song.  I have picked _Bells_ by Lhasa.

Here is a link to a video I first watched in the summer of 2013:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTJJoDwlLCs>.  It is how I was
introduced to Lhasa's entrancing art.

Below are the lyrics, followed by my philosophical commentary.

```
Bells

Bells are ringing
all through the drowned town
in the empty streets
and a hundred miles around

Bells are ringing
birds are flying upside down
my heart has been lost for too long

Bells are ringing
ships will be leaving
This was my home
Nothing's moving, nothing is breathing
Bells are ringing
ringing me from sleep
My sleep was not restful
but my dreaming was deep

Bells are ringing
and we both know
there's nothing left to do
but walk out there and go

You could lean your head down
and rest it on my knee
You could tell me a story
that does not end this way

Bells are ringing
and we both know
there's nothing left to do
but walk out there and go
```

I have listened to this song a hundred or more times over the years.
Lhasa communicated with me from the first moment.  Before I even paid
attention to the lyrics, I knew there was truth to be had in this work
of art.  This is a case where emotion precedes reason, where feeling
comes before thinking.  As an emotional agent, I connected with _Bells_
and with Lhasa immediately: we were in sync, despite the fact we could
never meet in person to exchange views and jointly discover our
intersecting points (Lhasa de Sela died in 2010).  In 2013, I still had
not ejected rationalism from my life.  I was the foolish young adult
who, while smart, is actually an idiot.  How can you trust your emotions
if you have not even listened to the words of the song?  How can there
possibly be anything reliable in that feeling?  Through trial and error,
I became a philosopher, which means that I eventually transcended the
false divide between reason and emotions: I applied wisdom in the
recognition that human is multifaceted.  It is reason _and_ emotion,
depending on the specifics.

Anyhow, this is not why we are here.  I believe _Bells_ inspires us to
think about profound concepts and understand who we are in relation to
magnitudes in our life which we do not control.

The ringing bells signify the end of an era.  An "era" can be many
things.  The end of autumn comes with the jingle bells that welcome the
new year, as the day starts to grow after the solstice in December.
Bells ring to announce an event, such as a gathering at a church, the
end of class at school, another ceremony of sorts.  The theme always is
one of transition.  Something ends, something else begins.  Circles
everlasting.  In our quotidian life we experience this continuity.
There is no emptiness in-between, no nothingness.  We are ever-present,
regardless of whether we go from something "good" to something "bad", or
vice versa.  The cosmos is ever-present.

Lhasa sings about a finality.  The ultimate terminus to our life is
death.  We all know about it.  There is no escape from it.  Our default
disposition is to fear the unknown.  We fear death because it is
inscrutable with the ordinary means at our disposal.  We build elaborate
conceptual structures to make ourselves feel better about it.  We codify
our hopes of a better place post-death in culture and religion as we
fear the ringing bell that awakens us from the slumber to remind us of
the inevitable.  We can always tell stories with an end that does not
involve death, though we know we are lying.

Fear of death is fear of the unknown.  It is the prejudice, the
deep-seated bias, that what we have is better than what we do not know.
This is a useful heuristic in life, but if we were to apply it
dogmatically, we would never push the boundaries of our knowledge.  We
would always be confined to whatever comfort zone.

The unknown is to be explored, not feared.  What we fear about death
consists in the fact that we are biased in favour of our current state.
We do not want to lose everything that gives value to our life: animals,
other people, the place we live, our faculties of sense and intellect...
We are dependent on them and so valorise them greatly.  Death takes all
that away.

Now one must wonder "what" exactly do we have, which we consider
preferable to that which we have not?  What is truly ours?  Is there
something specific that death takes away?  And, if so, where is it taken
to?

Did we choose to live?  No.  We make sense of who we are and how we are
alive after the fact.  Did we pick our parents, the place of our birth,
the milieu in which we were immersed in, the people that had an impact
on our life, and so on?  No.  We like to think that we are in control of
what happens to us, but this is an elaborate deception.  Our free will
is, at best, a fraction of what conditions our actuality.  Most factors
remain outside our control.

We do not even own our life.  There is this notion that one can take
away their life.  Metaphorically, we understand this.  Literally though,
it leaves something to be desired.  Take it where?  Who takes it from
whom?  Take "what" exactly?

Fundamentally, nothing is ours.  We have a sense of self, which we
develop as a subjective narrative based on our experiences in life and
how we see our own in relation---or juxtaposition---to them.  This
narrative is not ours either.  We know it, for example, from conditions
like amnesia or dementia.  One can be without a fixed sense of who they
are.

We know that nothing is ours, yet we pretend otherwise because it makes
us feel comfortable.  Instead of being honest with our condition as
humans, we entertain the falsehood of permanence in our life.  But the
ringing bells will always remind us of our hubris, of our unwillingness
to see what our humanity renders inescapable.

We fear and we suffer due to the false belief that we own "stuff" that
some force wants to separate us from.  Lies cannot alleviate the pain
and will not dispel that sense of dread.  They only make matters worse,
as it is lies that cause the problem in the first place.

When we are honest about our humanity, when we are honest about the
workings of the cosmos, we admit that every presence is subject to
transfiguration.  An era ends, another begins.  This is not the same as
saying that some kernel of our self---some true "I"---persists.  No.
The notion of a permanent self, typically referred to as the soul, is a
way of maintaining that illusion of ownership and permanence.  Besides,
if the soul carries on, why do we still fear death?  Maybe we don't have
much confidence in our stories, after all?

The lightness of being present in the moment comes from the realisation
that there is nothing to be gained or lost.  We simply are in the
here-and-now.  What happened before and what may happen afterwards is
outside our control.  What we think we can cling on to is elusive and
not ours to keep.  We are free from our falsehoods when we simply "walk
out there and go".  Let this era have your undivided attention.  What
happens afterwards is for that presence to deal with, with the means
available at its disposal, if any.

As Lhasa sings, "bells are ringing all through the drowned town in the
empty streets and a hundred miles around".  Does anyone listen?  Did we
get the reminder about our condition?  Or do we remain in denial; in a
state where our suffering masquerades as happiness?
