title: "Olives (my poem)"
excerpt: "Poetry on stale routines and their normalisation."
---

Though this section is about my philosophical interpretation of works
of art, what follows has no commentary.  It is my first ever poem.  I
just wrote it in one go and consider it complete.

```
Today's olives
taste unlike yesterday's
Years thus pass

Dear caring mind
you varied the routine
But I noticed
```
