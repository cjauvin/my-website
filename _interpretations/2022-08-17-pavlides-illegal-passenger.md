title: "Interpretation of “Illegal passenger” by Pavlos Pavlides"
excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a Greek song whose translated title is 'Illegal passenger'."
---

Pavlos Pavlides is a extraordinary songwriter whose beautiful songs add
colour to our life while also providing insight into profound meanings
and universal truths.  One such work is "Illegal passenger"
(Λαθρεπιβάτης): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljahjzRmLrE>.

Below are the lyrics, my translation of them, and subsequent
philosophical commentary.

Note that Pavlos was the lead singer of the old Greek rock band _Ta
Xylina Spathia_ (Τα Ξύλινα Σπαθιά, "The Wooden Swords").  I have already
interpreted a couple of their songs:

- [The king of dust](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2022-07-24-xylina-spathia-king-of-dust/)
- [At the rock](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2022-07-05-xylina-spathia-on-the-rock/)

Λαθρεπιβάτης

Τις περισσότερες φορές που ταξιδεύω με τα μάτια κλειστά
ένας μικρός λαθρεπιβάτης από δίπλα με κοιτάει σιωπηλά
Καμιά φορά μου τραγουδάει ένα απόκοσμο τραγούδι μα εγώ
κάθε φορά που επιστρέφω το ξεχνάω όσο και αν προσπαθώ.

Και όπως φεύγουνε οι μέρες και περνούν τα χρόνια
τόσο μοιάζει ν' αντηχεί πιο καθαρά
σαν κραυγή από πουλί που διψασμένο αιώνια
καθρεφτίζεται στης λίμνης τα νερά.

Τις περισσότερες φορές που επιστρέφω κουρασμένος αργά
ένα αόρατο θηρίο πλησιάζει κι ανασαίνει βαριά
Καμιά φορά μου διηγείται ιστορίες που ίσως έχουν συμβεί
Τις περισσότερες τις είπα και άλλες τόσες έχουν πια ξεχαστεί

Και όπως φεύγουνε οι μέρες και περνούν τα χρόνια
τόσο μοιάζει ν' αντηχεί πιο καθαρά
σαν αρχαίο βουητό που ταξιδεύει αιώνια
και σκορπάει στου καταρράκτη τα νερά

Τις περισσότερες φορές που ταξιδεύω με τα μάτια κλειστά
ένας μικρός λαθρεπιβάτης από δίπλα με κοιτάει σιωπηλά
Την προηγούμενη φορά του είχα πει κάπου σ' αυτή τη στροφή
ότι θα άλλαζα πορεία κι ότι πια δε θα μπορεί να με βρει
```

Illegal passenger

Most times while I travel with my eyes closed
a small illegal passenger watches me silently from the side
Sometimes he sings for me an otherworldly song, yet
each time I return forget it no matter how hard I try

And as the days go by and the years pass
so it seems to echo more clearly
as a cry of a bird which eternally thirsty
mirrors on the lake's waters

Most times I return late and tired
an invisible creature approaches and breathes heavily
Sometimes it tells me stories that may have happened
I have already told most of them and as many have been forgotten

And as the days go by and the years pass
so it seems to echo more clearly
as an ancient sound that travels eternally
and dissipates in the waterfall's waters

Most times while I travel with my eyes closed
a small illegal passenger watches me silently from the side
Last time I told him that somewhere on this turn
I would change course and that he wouldn't be able to find me
```

To me, the illegal passenger is an alien being that accompanies the
poetic "I" when it aspires to its highest.  It is "illegal" because the
instituted reality of humankind already has little tolerance for
foreigners, let alone otherworldly presences or lofty standards.

The illegal passenger figuratively is the deity that is always by the
artist's side, ready to support them in their endeavours.  This peculiar
fellow traveller is the source of inspiration of all great works and the
impetus for the apparent creativity of the person.

What Pavlos is doing here is to follow the several-millennia-long
tradition of not taking ownership for one's work.  The ancient Greek
creator would appeal to the Muses (goddesses of arts, letters, and
science) for inspiration.  The relevant Muse would sing and the human
would create.

The creator, then, is not the owner of the work that would
conventionally be assigned to them.  The intent of the Muse is to share
the message with humankind at-large.  It belongs to the cosmos.  The
creator is but a capable messenger, which is a great honour and a matter
of responsibility towards the world.

This is not to belittle anyone's work, but to couch it in terms of the
fact of non-ownership.  Sure, the legal order may envisage that words,
concepts, artefacts, etc. must have an owner, yet no law or edict may
render this relationship inalienable.  The thing being owned can subsist
or be conceptualised independent of its owner, and vice-versa.

[ Read/watch: [Who can be a
philosopher](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-08-07-who-can-be-philosopher/) ]

By attributing the work to the Muses or some illegal passenger, we stop
providing assent to the notion that anything can be owned.  We learn to
let go and, in the process, feel no disturbance when something or
someone is eventually---and inevitably---taken away from us.

We also acknowledge that we do not control how others will interpret our
works and how those may inspire them to also heed the call of the Muses.

The other meaning of the "illegal passenger" figure is that of the
misfit, the ever-alien, who speaks a truth whose profundity is only
realised years later.  They are a misfit exactly because they cannot be
assessed using ordinary criteria.  Going by appearances, the illegal
passenger is unremarkable and, at times, an altogether invisible
creature.

This reminds me of an occasion where I was asked if I earn an income
from philosophy.  The idea was to determine the worth of wisdom by the
proxy of profit.  I replied negatively, thus validating the person's
opinion on the uselessness of philosophy.

An artist may perform at some festival and earn an income.  A painter
might exchange their paintings for a sack of potatoes.  What about the
philosopher?  How much should this omniscient market pay for insights
that have the potential to remake a person, either directly or through
their reverberations?
