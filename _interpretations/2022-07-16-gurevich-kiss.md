title: "Interpretation of “Kiss” by Michelle Gurevich"
excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a song titled 'Kiss' by Michelle Gurevich."
---

Michelle Gurevich is a singer with a unique style that combines a witty
sense of humour, uncompromising honesty, and unapologetic ethos.
Michelle mostly sings about eroticism in the face of imperfect
conditions.

_Kiss_, the song I am about to provide philosophical commentary on,
feels to me like a "hidden gem".  It is not as intriguing as _Party
Girl_, not as hard-hitting as _First Six Months of Love_, not as
downbeat as _Friday Night_, and not as daring as _To Be With Others_.
On the face of it, _Kiss_ is a simple-minded song.  We'll see if that's
the case.

I could not find a video link, so this is the track on Bandcamp (from
the album _Ecstasy in the Shadow of Ecstasy_):

Below are the lyrics, followed by my comments.

```
Kiss

We've been friends
For a long time now
Missed our chance
For the window of romance

I can tell
Wouldn't take much to get there
Do you dare
Let this glance become a stare

Let's kiss and see what happens
Let's kiss and see what happens
Let's kiss and see what happens
Let's kiss and see what happens

Through the gate
Of your prime real estate
Oh the view
Darling sure looks good on you

Slow that kiss
Feels good to be nervous
I admit
I could get used to this
```

The salient point of this song is erotic---and I like it for that.
"Slow that kiss" and keep it real.  Though the core proposition of
deciding to do something is not limited to the act of kissing a lover.

Michelle basically encourages us to not overthink things.  It is okay to
have some sense of structure and a plan to follow.  Yet too much
analysis usually results in inaction.  The window of opportunity closes
and we are left to belittle ourselves for how useless we think we are.

To all introverts such as myself, Michelle speaks like the elder sibling
who gives quality advice on practical matters.  The introvert's capacity
for self-reflection is their greatest strength, though it also becomes a
curse if not managed properly.

We often dither and postpone important decisions.  Implicit in this
behaviour is the prejudice that chances occur in regular intervals: a
bit like public transport.  You missed the bus?  No problem, there's
another in ten minutes.  However, life does not work that way.  At least
not at all times.

We tend to think that some divine providence takes care of justice in
our little world.  If we behave nicely, we will definitely be rewarded.
Such is our hope.  While this can be plausible given certain conditions,
it tends to lead to complacency because we unquestionably rationalise
our dithering as a virtue.  As we become more experienced, we learn that
second chances are the exception to the rule.  Either we get it right
the first time, or we miss out.  It's gone forever!  What we are left
with is regret for what we missed and contempt for who we are.

Michelle's call to action is a classy one.  We do not want anyone to
turn into a creep.  This is about building on top of mutual respect.
There is nothing reckless in _Kiss_.  Nothing unilateral.  No-one is
entitled to anything.  What happens is the product of mutual consent
which culminates in the suggestion to go for a kiss.

Keeping it classy on erotic matters is just as important as with
everything else.  The fact that second chances are the exception does
not entail desert (in the sense of "merit"): we do not deserve anything
in advance.  We cannot get everything we want.  It is why we need to
strike a balance between the extremes of overthinking and recklessness:
to act when we can, but to do it from a position of knowledge and with
the utmost respect for others and our own self.

Knowledge can only come from a place of honesty.  We need to be patient
with ourselves and recognise when it is time to disinvest from a certain
goal or dream.  Not getting the things we want does not mean we are
worthless: it may simply be that we have the wrong desires.

We want the wrong things whenever we role-play; whenever we act in
conformity with the expectations imposed upon our person by our milieu.
We are misguided when we lack perspective and are not behaving
philosophically ([Who can be a
philosopher?](https://protesilaos.com/commentary/2022-07-15-who-can-be-philosopher/)).
To think that what we desire is _necessarily_ good for us---and indeed
achievable---is nothing but bias.

Those granted, there is another point in _Kiss_ that I notice (or
perhaps _imagine_, but please bear with me).  It revolves around the
theme of _falling in love_ versus _growing in love_.  As the verbs
suggest, to fall in love can happen almost by accident.  Tripping over,
so to speak, only to appreciate the other person through rose-tinted
glasses.  It is ephemeral and may be unreliable.  To grow in love though
presupposes sustainability.  It cannot be fuelled by momentary
enthusiasm alone.  This is why the song says "Wouldn't take much to get
there" because there exists a bond that can be strengthened.

This links back to the importance of finding a balance between the
extremes of overthinking and recklessness but also the vital insight of
keeping it classy.  When something is already embedded, there is no
point pretending otherwise.  Pretentiousness ultimately is
counter-philosophical: it is the attitude of lying to oneself.  The key
is to remain respectful and to never forget that no-one owes us
anything.

Think, but don't overthink.  Operate in a moderate way.
