title: "Interpretation of “Horoscope” by Christos Thivaios"
excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a song whose translated title is 'Horoscope'."
---

For this entry, I have picked _Horoscope_ (Ωροσκόπιο).  Before you
think that you do not believe in astrology: relax!  This has nothing
to do with it.  Just enjoy: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8bY3mOrgwI>.

The song is beautiful musically, but also has some profound lessons
for those of us who want to pay attention.  Also check my previous
entry on a song performed by Christos Thivaios: [Hamlet of the
Moon](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2022-07-14-thivaios-hamlet/).

Below are the original lyrics, my translation of them, and subsequent
philosophical commentary:

```
Ωροσκόπιο

Ερμηνεία:  Χρήστος Θηβαίος
Στίχοι:    Άλκης Αλκαίος
Μουσική:   Θάνος Μικρούτσικος


Μέρες βροχής κι ένας αέρας δυνατός
σε παρασέρνει σε αδέσποτο σεργιάνι
Σκηνές φιλμάρεις με μια κάμερα νυχτός
ξέμπαρκα μάτια και φευγάτα στο λιμάνι

Στην πολιτεία οι τοίχοι μάρτυρες βουβοί
Φορούν συνθήματα παλιά ξεθωριασμένα
Ξέρω θα φύγεις πριν χαράξει η αυγή
κι εγώ θα μείνω δίχως άλλοθι κανένα

Μην πεις ποτέ-ποτέ πως όλα ήτανε μια πλάνη
περιπλανήθηκα μαζί σου και μου φτάνει
Βάλε σημάδια μες στη νύχτα μη χαθείς
είναι πιο εύκολο να κλαις παρά να ζεις

Έλεγες «αύριο θα 'ναι ο κόσμος φωτεινός»
έλεγα «είναι με το μέρος μας ο χρόνος»
Δεν ειν' ο χρόνος με το μέρος κανενός
τις συμπληγάδες του περνά καθένας μόνος

Μην πεις ποτέ-ποτέ πως όλα ήτανε μια πλάνη
περιπλανήθηκα μαζί σου και μου φτάνει
Βάλε σημάδια μες στη νύχτα μη χαθείς
είναι πιο εύκολο να κλαις παρά να ζεις
```

```
Horoscope

Performance:  Christos Thivaios
Lyrics:       Alkis Alkaios
Music:        Thanos Mikroutsikos


Days of rain and a strong wind
takes you on a free roam
You capture scenes with a night vision camera
stray eyes and elusive at the port

At the polity the walls [are] silent witnesses
They wear old worn off slogans
I know you will leave before the crack of dawn
and I will remain with no alibi whatsoever

Never-ever say that all was a delusion
I wondered with you and it suffices
Place signs in the night to not get lost
It is easier to cry than to live

You said "tomorrow the world will be bright"
I said "time is on our side"
Time is on nobody's side
Each crosses its dire straits alone

Never-ever say that all was a delusion
I wondered with you and it suffices
Place signs in the night to not get lost
It is easier to cry than to live
```

The bad weather described in the opening lyrics is a reference to the
fact that (i) we operate under imperfect circumstances and (ii) life
is not always pleasant the way a warm sunny day with gentle breeze
normally is.  In essence, we do not exert control over the magnitudes
that inform, influence, frame, condition, or otherwise determine our
experiences.  We retain the impression of control over our disposition
towards what is happening and we have a kernel of volition manifesting
in the limited choices we can make.  Still, our will alone cannot undo
the "bad weather": it is not subject to our whim.

The polity is the instituted reality we have set up.  It consists of
constructs that are the product of our mind and conventions,
encapsulated in the substance of those writings on the walls.  Even
within this human-made milieu where we assign value and meaning, we
know that what is to transpire will do so despite our preference to
the contrary.  I wanted this shared moment to last an eternity: I
wanted what I could not get.

Our powerlessness to intervene in the workings of the cosmos does not
render those moments irrelevant.  We still experienced them, given our
means.  We cried, we laughed, we partook in ecstasy.  Eternity being
unrealisable for us does not cancel what happened to us.  Instead of
labelling them delusions, let us cherish the fact that we were in this
together.  In so doing, take notice of the moments, reminisce on what
took place, and remember to remain open to what unfolds in present
time.  Live the moment, for that is all that can be lived.

Time is not a magnitude we influence.  Its progress, the way we see
it, is inexorable.  We know this yet get trapped in our ways of
overthinking things.  We dither and delay taking action.  Our years go
by, postponement upon postponement.  Then we suddenly remember our
birthday and how we are 20-something, only to realise we are nearing
our 40s.  Fools!  We think that we will do it at a later stage
because, fundamentally, we are not prepared to admit the truth: time
is not ours.  Act now!  Tomorrow does not exist: you may not be around
by then.

As for those who stay behind, remind them of the here-and-now.
Encourage them, friend, to not discount what they had.  It was not a
series of lies _for them_.  And if you ever get the chance, do utter
those words you so wanted but kept inside---they may be your last.
