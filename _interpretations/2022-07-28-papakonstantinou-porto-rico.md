title: "Interpretation of “Porto Rico” by Vasilis Papakonstantinou"
excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a song whose title is 'Porto Rico'."
---

I have already commented on a song by Vasilis Papakonstantinou:
[Interpretation of “Trench
coat”](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2022-07-09-papakonstantinou-kabardina/).
Though I believe there are more items in his repertoire we could learn
from.

For this entry I have selected: _Porto Rico_.  We can treat it more as a
poem than the average song, though its music also makes it a noteworthy
contribution to the rock genre: <https://ww.youtube.com/watch?v=uPELcaItvFY>.
The second half, in particular, is exceptional.

Here are the lyrics, my translation, and philosophical commentary:

```
Πόρτο Ρίκο

Ερμηνεία:  Βασίλης Παπακωνσταντίνου
Στίχοι:    Άλκης Αλκαίος
Μουσική:   Σταμάτης Μεσημέρης


Φιγούρα ξωτική και ταξιδιάρικη
στο φως του φεγγαριού ανθίζει πάλι
γιατί όλη τη ζωή του την εξόδεψε
παράφορα γυρεύοντας μιαν άλλη

Θυμάμαι σαν παιδί γελούσε κι έλεγε
στη σέλα ακροβατώντας ποδηλάτου:
«Τον κόσμο εμείς θα φέρουμε στα μέτρα μας
πριν να μας φέρει εκείνος στα δικά του»

Μα ο κόσμος προχωρά χωρίς να μας ρωτά
κλεισμένοι δρόμοι, κλέφτες και αστυνόμοι
«αγάπα το κελί σου», του παν, κι ύστερα
έξω πιο μόνος μα γελούσε ακόμη

Μια νύχτα μεθυσμένη παίρνει ανάποδες
ημερολόγια καίει και πτυχία
Το χάραμα μπαρκάρει σε πειρατικό
για της ζωής του την σκηνοθεσία

Αλγέρι, Αλεξάνδρεια, South Africa
στο Άμστερνταμ δυο τέρμινα και κάτι
Γλιστρούσαν οι αγάπες μες στα μάτια του
σαν τον αφρό στα δάχτυλα του ναύτη

Στο Πόρτο Ρίκο χρόνια ασυλλόγιστα
και τις καρδιάς του σκόρπισε τα φύλλα
σε υπόγεια σκοτεινά και ύποπτα
λες και έψαχνε το φως μες στην ξεφτίλα

Κάποια ζεστή βραδιά σε ένα μπλουζάδικο
άκουσε να φαλτσάρει η μουσική του
τα αφεντικά στο δρόμο τον πετάξανε
τα στίγματα σαν είδαν στο κορμί του

Κι η Σύλβια που με πάθος τον αγάπησε
δεν έλειψε στιγμή απ' το πλευρό του
ζητώντας με μανία στην αγκάλη του
την κόλαση και τον παράδεισό του

Σαλπάρισε μια νύχτα με πανσέληνο
και στο στερνό του γράμμα μου 'χε γράψει:
«Αξίζει φίλε να υπάρχεις για ένα όνειρο
και ας είναι η φωτιά του να σε κάψει»

Τα χρόνια έχουν περάσει δε θυμάμαι πια
Ερνέστο τον ελέγανε η Νίκο;
Κι ακόμα συγχωρείστε με που ξέχασα
αν χάθηκε στο Μετς η στο Πόρτο Ρίκο

Όσο για μένα είμαι πάντα εδώ
με των ματιών σας την φωτιά σημαία
είναι όμορφα απόψε που ανταμώσαμε
μ' αρέσει να αρμενίζουμε παρέα
```

```
Porto Rico

Singer:  Vasilis Papakonstantinou
Lyrics:  Alkis Alkaios
Music:   Stamatis Mesimeris


Exotic and wondering figure
blossoms again in the moonlight
because he spent his whole life
passionately searching for another

I recall as a kid he would laugh and say
while balancing on a bicycle's seat:
"We'll bring the world to our measurements
before it brings us to its own"

But the world moves on without asking us
closed off streets, cops and robbers
"love your cell", they told him, and then
ever-so-lonely outside [the prison cell] yet he still laughed

On a drunken night he goes berserk
burns diaries and diplomas
At dawn he embarks on a pirate ship
for his life's art direction

Algiers, Alexandria, South Africa,
in Amsterdam two terminals and something
loves slipped through his eyes
like the froth at the sailor's fingers

Reckless years in Porto Rico
and he mindlessly scattered his heart's cards
in dark and suspicious basements
as if searching for light in humiliation

On a warm night at a blues bar
he heard his song out of tune
the masters threw him on the streets
as soon as they saw the spots on his body

And Sylvia who loved him with a passion
never left his side for a moment
desperately asking in his hug
his hell and heaven

He sailed off on full moon night
and in his final letter he wrote to me:
"It is worth it, friend, to live for a dream
even if its fire is to burn you"

The years have gone by and I can't recall anymore
Ernesto was his name or Nikos?
And further forgive me as I forgot
if he got lost in Metz or Porto Rico

As for me I'm always here
with the fire in your eyes as my flag
it is beautiful we've met tonight
I like that we travel together
```

Let's get this out real quick: "Ernesto" refers to Ernesto "Che"
Guevara, while "Nikos" is Nikos Beloyannis.  Both were political figures
who believed in the ideal of progressing towards a more just world.
They would not accept the established order as-is.  The song is thus
inspired by the politics of resistance, anti-imperialism, and
revolution, though its contents are not political, let alone communist,
per se.  They can be read in those terms, which is fair, though I want
to pivot towards a different direction.

When we speak of "politics" in everyday parlance, we tend to imagine
shrewd politicians on TV, conniving apparatchiks running things behind
the scenes, unscrupulous lobbyist exerting control at the centres of
power, shameless spin doctors weaving noble truths out of egregious
lies, and so on.  It is dirty and messy.  Yet "politics" also
encapsulates the instituted reality we all live in.

Our culture is a nexus of social norms, legal rules, and concomitant
roles.  It is underpinned by value judgements for practically every
aspect of life.  What it means to be a "girl", which job counts as
"manly", what is the place of the individual within the family structure
or the community, whether the younger generation gets any say in major
decisions, how wealth and resources are distributed among the members of
the group, what even constitutes a group, the way work is organised,
what is property or ownership, et cetera.  Every interpersonal relation
is underpinned, foreshadowed, framed, or otherwise conditioned by
politics.

It is an instituted reality because it is predicated on conventional
arrangements.  There is nothing strictly objective to it,
notwithstanding various rationalisations and apologias of the status quo
as the mechanistic outcome of "human nature".  What is instituted
necessarily can be re-instituted.  It can be fathomed in a new light.
It is possible, for example, to redraw the delineations of what a
"manly" job is, how resources are distributed among the members of the
social whole, who gets to decide for our common needs, and so on.

What is truly part of nature cannot be subject to institution.  Humanity
may not, for instance, decide that the Sun shall no longer rise from the
East or that lungs shall henceforth perform the function of the liver.
It is not institution that informs those magnitudes.

[ Read/watch: [Conventions, relativism, and
cosmopolitanism](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-02-21-relativism-cosmopolitanism/)
as well as [Expectations, rules, and
role-playing](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-05-03-expectations-rules-roles/) ]

While an instituted reality is not human-independent, it still remains
outside the purview of any given individual.  We must not conflate the
philosophical point on the non-objectivity of institutions, with the
practical perception of constancy as seen from the perspective of an
individual.

No person can, for example, unilaterally change how all others uphold
the various institutions.  In this regard, on this microscopic scale,
the individual can only treat the instituted reality as a given: it
simply is there and it influences everyone.  An individual cannot merely
proclaim that "it is all arbitrary, anyway!" and thus be emancipated
from the grip of the instituted reality.  This is why the song says that
the world can/will bring us to its measurements: we are cast in a mould
and are made in the image of the particular political milieu.  What
others think and decide---what has been codified as culture, tradition,
rules of conduct, wants and expectations, as well as legal order---has a
profound effect on our personhood and outlook from day one of our life.

Consider the diplomas that our rebellious hero destroys unceremoniously.
We live in a world in which we are our degrees and qualifications.  The
substance gets lost is or disregarded very easily.  A personal anecdote
is relevant.  I once applied for a job and was asked to supply proof of
my knowledge of English.  I have no formal document to support my
claims, as that requires a lot of money to acquire; money which not
everyone gets in life when they need it.  I told them that I have
written a zillion words on my website and can speak to them in person,
expound at length on matters I know about, produce any essay or report
for a test, and so on.  "Sorry sir, we need a certificate"...  To which
I replied: "no, you need a reality check".

The point is that whatever the individual may think is largely
irrelevant.  If the world around us works a certain way, we either
grow/shrink to fit its measurements or suffer the consequences of being
a misfit---and "suffer" is not a figure of speech here!  If we don't do
things the expected way, we will be marginalised and/or have trouble
finding opportunities.  This goes for potential employment positions,
but also for human relations at-large.  It is why the song mentions the
solitude outside the prison cell.

The poetic third person, here going by the name of Ernesto or Nikos,
speaks to us twice: (i) about the measurements of the world and whether
we should fit in, and (ii) that it is worth living one's dream.  We
already covered the former, so let us consider the latter.  I am of the
view that the meaning is encapsulated in this scene where the agent of
action burns diaries and diplomas.  I can relate to it through personal
experience.  The lyrics symbolise a turning point, where one decides to
walk their own path, whatever the cost.  It is not the rage of the
moment that provides the impetus.  Such is but the culmination of a long
and deliberate process of sincere self-reflection: we set new
priorities, cut ties with the past, strip away the fakery, and perform a
leap of faith into the unknown.

I, too, have discarded tokens of all sorts.  It is all those items which
serve as currency for social recognition.  Just visualise the pedantic
administrator who demands redeemable superficialities, else proof of our
prior conformity with the rules of the game, to assess our worth.  It is
not our qualities that are being put to the test, but the performative
aspect thereof.  It matters not whether one speaks English in practice,
for what is needed is the rubber stamp of whatever authority (salient or
otherwise).  Per this example, the administrator embodies the prevailing
mentality: they instantiate and enforce the instituted reality in the
given situation.

Who is Sylvia?  The fellow human, here a lover, who appreciates our
Ernesto/Nikos for who he is, not who society wants him to be.  Sylvia,
then, has the resolve and perseverance to look past the phenomenalities
in order to find the real person within.  In this sense, Sylvia shares
the same goal as her lover.  She is yet another Ernesto or Nikos who
seeks the truth, who wants to discover what one's true self is, and who
is prepared to show to the powers that be how there exists an
alternative and how we needn't all be put to the Procrustean Bed in
order to fit the measurements of the world.  One size does not suit
everybody.  Such is a dream worth living.  May its purifying fire burn
incessantly.
