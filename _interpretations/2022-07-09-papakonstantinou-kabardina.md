title: "Interpretation of “Trench coat” by Vasilis Papakonstantinou"
excerpt: "Translation of a Greek song titled 'Trench coat' and comments on its meaning."
---

Vasilis Papakonstantinou is a legend among Greek singers.  Most of his
songs are in the rock genre.  I first listened to his work as a teenager
circa 2006, when I bought two CDs out of curiosity.  One of them was
from the live concert at the [Herodion theatre in
Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odeon_of_Herodes_Atticus).  I have
enjoyed listening to Papakonstantinou ever since.

For this publication, I decided to translate and then comment on
_Καμπαρντίνα_ (Kabardina, Trench coat).  This is the version of song
from the aforementioned live concert:

video of the performance, which is a thing of beauty in its own right:

Here are the original lyrics, followed by my translation and commentary:

```
Καμπαρντίνα

Ερμηνεία:  Βασίλης Παπακωνσταντίνου
Στίχοι:    Λευτέρης Παπαδόπουλος
Μουσική:   Χριστόφορος Κροκίδης


Φορούσε άσπρη καμπαρντίνα
και βάδιζε στον κόσμο του,
κομμάτια έγινε η βιτρίνα,
που βρέθηκε στο δρόμο του.

Κόβει τη νύχτα η σειρήνα,
τα μπλόκα μπαίνουν στη σκηνή,
τον τύλιξαν στην καμπαρντίνα
και τον αδειάσαν στο κελί.

Μόνο η βροχή ξέρει
και λέει τραγούδι βουβό.
Μόνο η βροχή κλαίει
μ' ένα τραγούδι μισό.

Τη φυλακή δεν την μπορούσε,
θα φύγω είπε κι από δω,
η σήραγγα τον οδηγούσε
απ' έξω στο άπιαστο κενό.

Αέρας μπαίνει στο κελί του,
ξυπνάει όλη η φρουρά,
στοίχημα βάλαν τη ζωή του,
μην τους ξεφύγει άλλη φορά.

Γαλόνια χάσαν την τιμή τους,
κυκλώσαν όλη την Αθήνα,
με τη χαμένη υπόληψη τους
να κυνηγάει μια άσπρη καμπαρντίνα.

Μόνο η βροχή ξέρει
και λέει τραγούδι βουβό.
Μόνο η βροχή κλαίει
μ' ένα τραγούδι μισό.

Φορούσε άσπρη καμπαρντίνα
και βάδιζε το δρόμο του,
οι σφαίρες βγήκαν απ' τα σκίνα
και χώθηκαν στον ώμο του.

Έμεινε λίγο σαστισμένος
μπερδεύτηκε το βήμα του,
σκέφτηκε, είμαι σκοτωμένος
και μπήκε μες στο μνήμα του.

Ύστερα βγήκε ο δολοφόνος
κρατώντας ένα δίκανο,
δήλωσε, τι ωραίος φόνος
και μ' έλεγαν ανίκανο.

Μόνο η βροχή ξέρει
και λέει τραγούδι βουβό.
Μόνο η βροχή κλαίει
μ' ένα τραγούδι μισό.

Trench coat

Singer:  Vasilis Papakonstantinou
Lyrics:  Lefteris Papadopoulos
Music:   Christophoros Krokidis


He was wearing a white trench coat
and walked in his own world,
shattered into pieces was the facade,
that stood in his way.

The siren cuts through the night,
the blockades enter the scene,
they wrapped him in the trench coat
and threw him in the prison cell.

Only the rain knows
and sings a muted song.
Only the rain cries
with half a song.

He could not stand the prison,
I'll leave from here as well he said,
the tunnel was taking him
outside to the uncatchable void.

Wind enters his cell,
the whole guard awakens,
they bet on his life,
never to lose him again.

[Military] ranks lost their value,
circled all of Athens,
with their lost pride
hunting down a white trench coat.

Only the rain knows
and sings a muted song.
Only the rain cries
with half a song.

He was wearing a white trench coat,
and was walking along his path,
the bullets came out of the bushes
and penetrated his shoulder.

He stood a bit confounded
he lost his step,
he thought, I have been killed
and entered his tomb.

Then came the murderer
holding a double-barrelled rifle,
declared, what a beautiful murder
and they called me incompetent.

Only the rain knows
and sings a muted song.
Only the rain cries
with half a song.
```

I think the salient point of this song is a critique against the vanity
of authority.  How the establishment will go to great lengths to ensure
that everyone conforms with its demands.  Sometimes the powers that be
take the form of security forces: the police and the military.  At
others, it is an imperialistic apparatus that will employ all means
necessary to wage war against---or otherwise undermine---countries that
do not fit in its vision of a world order.  At others still, the
establishment is a cobweb of unwritten rules, social norms, and
institutions that govern how people behave in their interpersonal
affairs and how they treat misfits.

The "misfit" is the operative term.  We can interpret the story in the
song as the typical cops versus criminals scenario, though I hold that
the notion of a white trench coat is a metaphor for an irregular
presence, as seen from the perspective of any given establishment.  How
often do you see white trench coats, anyway?  I have never encountered
one.  They tend to be dark in colour.  If, then, people expect to see us
dressed in a dark coat and we wear a white one instead, they will
consider us weird.  Fashion choices are not the issue here, but only the
core idea of being different and challenging expectations.

The misfit in the song is wondering in their own world.  The broken
facade is a poetic construct that captures pretences; appearances to
intellectuality and sophistication; appearances to tolerance and
open-mindedness; appearances about lofty values and ethical standards.
Every society, every establishment, thinks of itself as great and
righteous.  Americans bring democracy to parts of the world.  Europeans
safeguard "European values".  Russians engage in "special operations"
for the de-nazification of countries...  Everyone is righteous.

The white trench coat will have none of that humbuggery.  It shatters
all forms of hypocrisy that stand in its path.  Power, however, does not
take kindly to those who do not fall in line.  It will tolerate them
only for as long as they are not a threat to it.  Otherwise it will
utilise everything at its disposal to turn that white trench coat into a
straitjacket or, ultimately, a cloth to wrap a dead body with.

Casting misfits into a mould is the kind of ordinary procedure that goes
unnoticed.  This is why only the rain knows about it.  When people take
something for granted, they do not question it and will not see how
preposterous it is.  What is the problem with wearing a white trench
coat, contrary to the prevailing fashions?  Nothing whatsoever.  The
metaphor shows us how an otherwise small thing can become a big deal.
Us being ourselves rubs others the wrong way.  Combined with phobia,
this phenomenon has the potential to trigger their most repressive,
authoritarian reflexes.  That is the moment when authority appeals to
its power to enforce its ways.  The "beautiful murder" of a misfit is
how the one-size-fits-all is applied.

The establishment does not always need to resort to brutality.  It can
apply the softer touch of indoctrinating us.  We internalise its value
judgements as our own.  We uncritically echo what we have been told and
blithely join the rest in becoming the establishment and in committing
the hubris of self-righteousness.  Why?  To not be bullied and harassed.
To fit in with the lads.  To be cool like everybody else.  _To be
happy_.

[ Read/watch: [Expectations, rules, and
role-playing](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-05-03-expectations-rules-roles/) ]

Indoctrination does not happen only in a formal setting, such as at
school.  It is a daily affair.  The culture's norms are embedded in
patterns of collective action and eventually inform each person's
subjectivity.  Forget about guns and violence.  Consider those seemingly
innocuous exhortations about something as trivial as hair:

* "Men cannot have long hair."
* "Ladies must not have hair on their forearms."

You get the idea.  Maybe you agree with those views.  It is okay to have
an opinion.  The problem starts when this opinion elevates itself to the
status of authority and now serves as justification for every "beautiful
murder" imaginable.  Cutting one's long hair while they are asleep---a
beautiful murder of personality.  Pressuring one to remove the hair from
their arms---a beautiful murder of the potential for self-expression.
And so on.

Social-cultural institutions will always exist.  Just as individual
organisms, so do societies reproduce their kind.  Expectations develop
interpersonally as an emergent mechanism of cultural propagation.  This
is not to say that we are doomed into a state of perpetual tyranny or
that everything we have been taught is wrong and we must abolish it
outright.  No.  Just that we should evaluate our own culture on the
basis of reasonableness, remain sceptical of what we have, and do not
participate in inflating our collective ego.  That some notion found
currency among our ancestors does not mean, ipso facto, that we too
ought to keep it around forever.

I already mentioned the concept of internalising prevailing beliefs.  We
learn to judge ourselves from the third person view of society.  All
those standards about how we look, how we feel, what we ought to do in
order to count as worthy, are all part of our social conditioning: we
think in those terms.  It is how we develop false wants and set
misguided goals in our life.  When we inevitably fail to meet the
target, we blame ourselves for it: [we hate who we
are](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2022-07-01-memphis-sweet-paradox/),
we loath the failure we have become.  In doing so, we do not recognise
the key distinction between our underlying actuality and the idols we
make out of our self; idols which operate within the domain of any given
role-playing expectation, such as that of having a successful career,
being a manly man, behaving and looking like a lady, et cetera.

Internalisation of this sort clouds our judgement.  It prevents us from
being honest.  We take the righteousness of our milieu as a given and
inevitably rationalise our condition as one of self-induced agony.  This
is prejudice writ large, as we now assume the role of the murderer who
finds fulfilment in assassinating our character.  Honesty is about
wearing our white trench coat and walking in our own world.  We do not
fear to [explore who we are by understanding what the world
is](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2022-07-05-xylina-spathia-on-the-rock/).
This is not done for the sake of being contrarian or to merely upset
others.  We simply want to know what the truth is, not what passes as
acceptable.  Our very nature predisposes us thus.

By being true to ourselves, we indirectly help others realise that there
is another way.  The authoritative view is not the single source of
truth it purports to be.  Of course, we can always try to fit in and be
"normal".  Sometimes it is possible to mask our actuality and be who
others want to see.  Though it is unsustainable over the long-term.  One
cannot pretend forever.  There will be a reckoning.  It then is a matter
of becoming the change we want to enact.  And who knows?  Courage is
contagious---others might join us in placing a check on the authority's
vanity and in working towards a more tolerant and genuinely open-minded
culture.  Enough with the "you should be".  Focus on the "you are" and
learn to appreciate the value in what you have.
