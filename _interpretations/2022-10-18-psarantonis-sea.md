title: "Interpretation of “My sea” by Psarantonis"
excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a song whose translated title is 'My sea'."
---

For this entry, I have picked a song from the island of Crete titled
_My sea_ (Θάλασσα μου): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wlY972bjDk>.
It is performed by the legendary Antonis Xylouris (Αντώνης Ξυλούρης).
The singer's nickname is "Psarantonis" (Ψαραντώνης), which literally
means "fisher-Antonis".  It is tradition in Greece to pass a nickname
through the generations, although this typically happens when the
children have common names so they need something else to identify
them (I didn't get the "kofteros" ("sharp") nickname because my name
is unique).

What follows are the original lyrics, my translation of them, and
subsequent philosophical commentary.

```
Θάλασσα μου

Ερμηνεία:  Αντώνης Ξυλούρης (Ψαραντώνης)
Στίχοι:    Γιάννης Παξιμαδάκης
Μουσική:   Γιάννης Παξιμαδάκης


Θάλασσα μ'εσένα έχω καημό
που δεν μπορείς, θάλασσά μου,
μες τα μπλέ σου τα νερά
να πνίξεις τον καημό μου

Όπως έπνιξες καράβια
και θαλασσινούς, Θάλασσά μου,
τον καημό μου τώρα πνίξε
πνίξε να σωθώ

Στ' άσπρο σου το κύμα απάνω
βάλε με να ζω, θάλασσά μου,
να κοιτώ πουλιά, καράβια
και τον ουρανό

Να κοιτώ και το φεγγάρι
μες τα σύννεφα, θάλασσά μου,
σαν και την καρδιά μου
να'ναι τοσο σκοτεινό
```

My sea

Performance:  Antonis Xylouris (Psarantonis)
Lyrics:       Giannis Paximadakis
Music:        Giannis Paximadakis


Sea with you I am sad
as you cannot, my sea,
in your blue waters
drown my grief

As you drowned ships
and sailors, my sea,
my grief now drown
drown it to save me

On top of your white waves
place me to live, my sea,
to stare at birds, ships
and the sky

To stare at the moon
amid the clouds, my sea,
which like my heart
is so dark
```

To me, the sea symbolises the open-ended adventure some of us yearn
for: the sense of amazement, exploration, and discovery.  As humans,
we seek awesome experiences.  A breathtakingly colourful sunset, the
highest vantage point, the play of light as rays of sunlight reflect
in the morning dew...  We love all that!

There is an aspect to our being that is fundamentally disturbed by
boredom.  We appreciate a sense of stability, but we also need
something fresh from time-to-time.  The adventurer, however, is one
who lives for the adventure.  To them, stability is intrinsically
boring and whatever balance between old and new is but an unpleasant
compromise.

I suppose one is thrilled to venture into the unknown because of their
very constitution.  Their nature compels them to push forward.  Are
they searching for something though?  Is the adventurer moving towards
the horizon in the hope of finding something, or is the trip itself
the reward?  Perhaps a permutation in-between those extremes?  My
introspection tells me that what appears as one chasing their luck is,
at times, them running away from it.  There is something they want to
drown in the murky depths of some distant ocean.

Suppose you have what you would consider the most preferable setup in
your life.  Let's go with the common choice and say this includes a
stable source of income, a partner with whom you are mutually
compatible and in love with, a house in some fancy place, pleasant
neighbours, good health, and the like.  Do you cast all that to the
wind and go on an adventure?  I think not.  Those who are more likely
to leave it all behind are the ones who feel that the potential
benefit outweighs whatever immediate cost.  The "leave it all behind"
may amount to nothing, after all, which makes the decision
considerably easier.

I understand this sentiment of foregoing conventional comfort and
doing something out-of-the-ordinary.  I did it!  Was there a tacit
desire there for a terminus?  Maybe it was codified in feelings that
were never expressed?  Or maybe it was latent in some rationalisation?
At any rate, I feel this tendency to entertain notions of doom and
gloom is driven by tunnel vision: we let the grief of the present
preclude potential outcomes that may not consist in misfortune.  Our
decision-making is governed by the bias that we are omniscient: we
pretend to know what the future has in store for us and how we will
experience the world.  It is also influenced by our misplaced sense of
duty and significance: we assume too many responsibilities/burdens and
think that everybody is judging us accordingly.  In truth, we are not
the epicentre and none of that matters to the extent we think it does.

Your heart may be as dark as the clouded night sky.  What you proclaim
as a fascinating escapade is a tacit hope to meet your demise while in
the open seas.  I know.  Though as with the weather, the clouds do not
stay around forever.  To think that the current sorrow necessitates
eternal sadness is to make too many false assumptions.

No sea can drown your sorrow.  It can only kill you.  Whatever
solution has to come from within: it is rooted in a disposition of
aloofness, of not worrying too much, not assigning great value to
things, not being fatalistic in the presumption that you know
everything.  Let life run its course.  Admit that you are human.  You
do not have all the answers.  Let go of what life tells you is not
yours.

Take it easy, for you know less than you think.
