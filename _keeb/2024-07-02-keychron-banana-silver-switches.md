In early spring 2024 Keychron was running a sale on all of their
products. They have a line of switches called "Keychron K Pro" (not to
be confused with the "K Pro" keyboards). The regular price of those
switches is 16 USD for a tube of 110 items. For comparison, other
models from manufacturers like Gateron and Kailh are priced above 20
USD, some even reaching closer to a 100 dollars. I decided to buy a
set of Banana switches and another of the Silver ones for less than 20
dollars with the discount. This was such a great value for money and
taught me a lot along the way.

## The switches I was using before

The Iris keyboard I got from Keebio (thanks for "Andreas" for the
donation) shipped with the Durock Shrimp switches. These have a
tactile behaviour that is marketed as "silent". Indeed, they are on
the quiet side and I was originally impressed with their performance.
Though after some weeks of daily usage, I started noticing metallic
noises coming from some of the most heavily used switches. There was
an unmistakable pinging and clicking.

I did not like this development, because it ran contrary to the idea
of using a silent switch. I learnt about lubricants and did lube a few
of the worst offenders. The results were not much better, so I decided
to abandon that project. There probably is value to be had in lubing
and also in filming switches, though I am not prepared to go to that
end unless it is a game changer. My small sample size suggests this is
more about marginal gains, to perfect an already outstanding build.

The extra noise coming from the Durock switches is not an annoyance
per se. I do not mind using loud switches. Though if I really wanted
something clicky, I would opt for something like the Kailh Box
Jade/Navy and enjoy both the unapologetic clicks and the authoritative
tactility.

## The Keychron Silver switch

Those are light linear switches with an early pre-travel and short
total travel for an MX style design. As with most (all?) linear
switches of this sort, these are marketed for office and gaming. I am
not a gamer, so my experience is limited to typing prose and code.

According to the manufacturer, these are the specifications, which I
compare with the Red variant (the de facto standard linear switch):

| Keychron K Pro Switch | Operating force | Pre-travel | Travel distance |
|-----------------------+-----------------+------------+-----------------|
| Silver                | 42±8gf          | 1.3±0.3mm  | 3.3±0.2mm       |
| Red                   | 45±10gf         | 2±0.4mm    | 4±0.4mm         |

My first impression with the Silver switches was that they were super
light, perhaps "too light". Coming from the heavier and tactile Durock
Shrimps (50g actuation force at 2mm), the Keychron Silvers felt like
typing in a vacuum. There was no perceptible resistance and I would
frequently actuate the keys just by resting my fingers on them. The
first days with this setup were really awkward, as I kept misfiring
keys. Though I wanted to give the switches a fair chance, so I powered
through.

Once I got used to the Silvers, I found their lightness to not be a
hindrance anymore. It was the impetus I needed to improve my accuracy
and technique. I learnt how to rest my fingers on the home row without
accidentally typing the corresponding characters. As for the change
from a tactile to a linear behaviour, I found this to not be a big
issue either. I am perfectly happy working with linear switches,
especially those super light ones, because I know that every minor
motion counts as a key press: the tactile or audible feedback is not
necessary once you get used to this workflow.

One downside of such light switches is that it is easy to bottom out
with them, especially while you are getting used to their force/travel
curve. During my "awkward phase" with them, I was bottoming out hard
and ultimately had to slow down to avoid harming my RSI-ridden left
arm and wrist. Perhaps it is this deliberate slowdown that allowed me
to work on my technique. I still make the occasional mistake, though I
find I am more accurate with my key presses and can touch type
effectively (only on the columnar stagger of my Iris though, as the
standard row stagger still is hard for me).

I could keep using the Silver switches and I would be a happy
customer. Though I still had another set I needed to try...

## The Keychron Banana switch

When I first got the package from Keychron, I tested the Silver and
Banana switches without installing them on my keyboard. The Silver one
was clearly different from what I was used to and is why I opted to
try it first. While the Bananas felt strange. They had the expected
tactile feedback (more on that below), but their behaviour was still a
departure from the Durock Shrimps, as well as the Brown/Blue switches
I have on my Keychron K5 Pro keyboard (thanks to Arialdo Martini for
this gift).

Again, here is a table comparing the various switches. Note that the
Durock Shrimps are, in my experience, closer to the Brown ones though
the tactile bump is probably a bit more noticeable.

| Keychron K Pro Switch | Operating force | Pre-travel | Travel distance | Behaviour     |
|-----------------------+-----------------+------------+-----------------+---------------|
| Silver                | 42±8gf          | 1.3±0.3mm  | 3.3±0.2mm       | Linear        |
| Red                   | 45±10gf         | 2±0.4mm    | 4±0.4mm         | Linear        |
| Brown                 | 50±10gf         | 2±0.4mm    | 4±0.4mm         | Tactile       |
| Blue                  | 60±10gf         | 2±0.4mm    | 4±0.4mm         | Clicky        |
| Banana                | 57±8gf          | 2.2±0.4mm  | 3.3±0.2mm       | Early Tactile |

The tactility of the Banana switches is unique among all the switches
I have tried. This is because of the distribution of force and travel
required to actuate a key press. In common switch types like the Brown
and Blue, the tactile bump is placed somewhere in the middle. You
first press down a bit, then experience the bump where the resistance
increases, and then you continue pressing down linearly again. Whereas
in the Banana switch there is practically no pre-travel: it starts
with the tactile bump and bottoms out early after that.

Before trying out the Bananas, my initial impression of them was
negative. I thought they were too squishy for a tactile switch. But I
know not to hold on to incomplete thoughts, so I was committed to try
them out in earnest after forming an informed opinion about their
Silver counterparts.

Moving from the Silvers to the Bananas was a revelation. The two
switches share attributes of an early actuation and short total
travel, so I was already used to typing in the optimal way for them
without bottoming out.

What I like about the Bananas as opposed to the Silvers is the
addition of the early tactility. Like the Silvers, they let me type by
pressing at the tip of the key, though the Bananas also empower me to
sense the "pulse" of the keyboard along the way. As a bonus, the added
weight on the Bananas when compared to the Silvers reduces potential
errors at higher typing speeds. It is an upgrade to my mechanical
keyboard experience overall.

## Keep an open mind

Both the Silver and Banana switches failed to capture my imagination
at the outset. I know not to commit to early thoughts and was
determined to give both of them a fair chance. I think they are high
quality products. Once we factor in their comparatively low price
point, they are extra good.

My appreciation for those switches was developed as that of an
acquired taste rather than love at first sight. There is so much to
learn about our own preferences while using mechanical keyboards. We
continue to develop new ones as we go and we continuously adapt to
evolving states of affairs. Right now, I am settled with the Banana
switches, though I remain open to the possibility of experiencing
something different. I will not write "better" because I cannot
provide a reliable scoring system. This includes the Durock Shrimps as
well: I think I dislike their added noise because of my expectation
for them to be silent, but otherwise would not mind having extra
audible feedback while typing, provided it was consistent.

I now expect this same kind of gradual appreciation to be made
manifest as I revisit my MT3 ortholinear keycap set. What [I wrote
before about MT3](https://protesilaos.com/keeb/2024-05-13-mt3-keycap-profile-impressions/)
is that it is of high quality but I could not get used to the keycap
profile itself. Perhaps I will change my opinion after trying it for a
while with the Banana switches. My technique is different now, so
there is a chance I will like the height and shape of MT3 this time (I
always recognised its premium build quality). What matters though is
that this deep dive into mechanical keyboards has helped me cope with
my RSI as well as to fine-tune my sense for the little things involved
in a typist's everyday experience.
