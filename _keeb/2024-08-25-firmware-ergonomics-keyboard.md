In this ~25-minute video I explain the more subtle design choices that
go into my split mechanical keyboard. Those pertain to the use of the
thumb cluster and the total number of keys. With careful consideration
of my use-case, I have optimised for comfort without sacrificing any
kind of functionality.

Concretely, I discuss some features of QMK about one-shot modifiers,
modifier/layer lock, and the repeat key. I also talk about the
combination of those with sculptured keycaps and easy-to-actuate key
switches.
