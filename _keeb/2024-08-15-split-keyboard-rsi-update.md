In this video I talk about how the split ergonomic keyboard I got
earlier this year helped me partially recover from RSI. I still need
more time to fully recover from the injury, though this setup is
helping me greatly.

I also talk about keyboard enthusiast themes regarding switches, caps,
and related issues.
