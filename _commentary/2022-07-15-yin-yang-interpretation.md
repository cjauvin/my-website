What follows is an excerpt from an email exchange that I reproduce with

I agree with your interpretation, though I have not studied Taoism (not
yet, anyway).  Some further thoughts...

The two colours are opposites, yet their opposition is not in their
capacity as colours but in their attributes.  In more abstract terms,
black and white are the same, as both are a colour/tone.  When we then
think of extremes, we should consider that which binds them together or
that common thread running through them.

For this reason I have a concept of "the scope of application".  What I
mean by this is that in every inquiry we operate at a given level of
abstraction.  If I argue that "black and white are the same" you should
not think I am crazy and am speaking nonsense.  Rather you should offer
me a chance to explain my reasoning, at which point I would remark that
the scope of application at which I operate omits the attributes that
make those two different: it is more abstract.

The scope of application influences another concept I have: "the
constitution of the case".  This is about the given factors in their
interplay.  For example, if we say a person's hair is black, our scope
of application is at the level of the hair as a whole, so we leave out
factors such as what is happening at the stratum where vitamins are
processed to produce hair, what happens to give it colour and shape, and
so on.

Note that "scope" derives from a Greek word that denotes sight.  Hence,
tele-scope (afar-sight), peri-scope (around-sight), micro-scope
(small-sight)...  The Yin-Yang image, and every image for that matter,
has at least one scope of application: that of its pictorial
representation, i.e. what we see.  Though images are likely to contain
multiple scopes.  If I look at the picture as a whole, I see a circle.
If I am more attentive, I can discern the patterns of Yin and Yang, as
well as how a bit of each is found in the other---an interesting detail.
The more complex the image, the more likely it is that there are
multiple scopes of application.

What the image itself already tells us, provided we have the disposition
to accept it, is that the scope of application defines the constitution
of the case which, in turn, foreshadows what we may comprehend.

Back to the meaning of the Yin-Yang symbol.  It encapsulates what I
think of the cosmos.  At the most abstract level, all is one.  All that
moves is, holistically, static: it is not going anywhere because it is
all there is.  All that changes is, in those terms, constant.
Differences in appearance, motion and rest, transfiguration are all
discernible at certain scopes of application.  Again, if I say "all is
one" I am not speaking nonsense.  Though if I leave it at that, I am
committing the error of not clarifying that the case can be
reconstituted as such, as another scope of application may be drawn.

The Yin-Yang symbol inspires us to think of particularities in terms of
totality.  We are invited to appreciate the vital insight that nothing
has a standalone presence.  It necessarily exists in something.  Within
the confines of the image, this is understood as Yin always being framed
by Yang and vice-versa as both exist within the greater whole of the
circle.

All this may sound irrelevant for our daily life.  I think that is a
mistake.  They are directly applicable to what we do.  Just imagine how
much more tolerant we would all be if we appreciated how the
constitution of the case determines our thinking.  We would then
understand open-mindedness not as virtue signalling (everyone claims to
be open-minded) but as the eagerness to consider in earnest a
differently constituted case.

This is why I think Yin and Yang are lessons for life.  Philosophy, in
general, is not a strictly academic pursuit for intellectuals to pass
their time while sounding smart.  It pertains to the all-too-practical
here-and-now of our quotidian life.  Whether individual philosophers do
a good job at communicating as much is another discussion.
