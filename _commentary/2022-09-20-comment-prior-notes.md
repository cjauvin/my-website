Hello Gabriel!  My approach to note-taking is to (i) be mindful of one's
ignorance and (ii) give the author the benefit of doubt.  It is okay to
record notes while reading a book.  Those are "bookmarks" of sorts or
"reminders" more broadly.  The nuanced point is to not be opinionated
about stuff you do not know.  The notes must then be sufficiently
generic so that they do not condition your thinking down the line.

An example of an "ignorant note" is when you start reading a nuanced
article.  Paragraph 3 elaborates on a fine point which is only rendered
clear in light of paragraph 10.  But as you read through the text, you
stop at paragraph 3 and record your opinion: "this is ridiculous,
because [...] and then we should consider [...]".

Imagine you accumulate lots of those "ignorant notes" and revisit them
after reading the article/book to determine what you have learnt: they
are giving you a distorted picture.  Whereas "reminders/bookmarks" will
help you retrieve some finer detail, but you do not rely on them to form
an opinion: they are generic.  You only form an opinion when you have a
sense of the complete work.

My approach depends on one's familiarity with the subject matter.  The
more you know something, the less work you need to anticipate what some
new information is telling you.  For example, someone who has no idea
who Hegel is should not start reading and take notes like "this is some
absurd mumbo-jumbo [...]"---that simply reflects their ignorance and
prejudice.  Instead, they should take it slow to understand what Hegel
is saying in each section.  Whatever notes should be of the "reminder"
sort: generic and with no intent to be argumentative.

To me, notes embody knowledge that my future self will find useful.
They are points of entry to a larger corpus of work.  As such, notes
will be taken after I am familiar with the source material.  That way, I
do not allow "past ignorant me" to condition the thinking of "future
knowledgeable me".

Does this make sense?

By the way, can I publish this on my website?  I want to quote your
message and my reply to it, as this might help others who have similar
questions.  I will keep your name a secret (unless you want it to be
public).  What do you think?

I probably did not explain it properly, so let me retry.  In the example
of politics, you are not presented with a totally new subject matter.
You are already familiar with it.  Perhaps this is your homeland, you
have been reading the news, have an understanding of the country's
history, know the people and their culture, etc.  It is perfectly fine
to have an opinion about politics.

I am not suggesting that we should only speak when we are the foremost
experts on the subject because then no-one will ever speak.  There is
always something that eludes us (strictly speaking).  My point is to not
be dogmatic at the outset and try to understand what the facts are or
what the author is saying without filtering them/it through our prior
beliefs, to the extent possible.

Instead of politics, think about an example with programming.  I started
using Emacs in the summer of 2019 as a non-programmer.  All those
parentheses of Elisp were alien to me.  I did not understand anything
and was confused the whole time.  But I did not form an opinion about
Elisp because I recognised my ignorance.  Any opinion would have been
unreliable at that stage, such as "why use parentheses when you can add
extra spacing?"  Now I know there is a good reason for those
parentheses, but I wouldn't have learnt as much if I had let my prior
beliefs govern my thinking.
