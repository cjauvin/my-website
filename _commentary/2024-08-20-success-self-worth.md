What follows is an excerpt from a private exchange. I am sharing it
with the permission of my correspondent, without revealing their
personal details. The quoted/indented parts are those I am replying
to. I asked to publish this because I think it can be useful to many
people.

It is understandable that you question yourself. The facts do not
align with your expectations, so taking the time to understand what is
going on is important. Self-reflection and the requisite constructive
criticism can help you correct your course and find something that is
benign for you.

Though note that self-criticism can also be unfair, such as in the
case of assuming the full burden of responsibility for this state of
affairs you are describing. It may be that you do not have the skills
to pursue this career. Or you have the skills but are in the wrong
place at the wrong time. Or there may even be some other factor, such
as your interests being too niche or too mainstream. There are lots of
possibilities. Remember then not to attribute everything that is
happening to your self only and to tell yourself narratives like "I
did not get the position because I am a failure".

Those kinds of narratives are too simplistic and end up being unfair
on the person who formulates them. Several things can be true at the
same time, which means that it is not helpful to frame this matter as
one of "ability versus inability [for a PhD programme]". I think it is
better to say that you cannot know for sure what the reason is---and
even if there is a clearly discernible reason to begin with---so given
this uncertainty, it is premature to reach conclusions about your own
worth.

You will still need to adapt, but you do it without loathing your
self. Some things are not meant to be and it ultimately is irrelevant
why that is. What matters in the moment you are in is to deal with
what you have. The idea that a person's self-worth is measured by how
well they accomplish their goals is problematic because the person
does not control all the relevant factors. Moreover, in this case
there is a presumption that the person sets out goals that are
necessarily aligned with their abilities. But why should we assume
this to be true? Someone can set out to do something that does not
work for them. If, for example, I try my best to out-compete an elite
basketball player and fail in the process, I did not lose my worth but
only realised that my ambition was not consistent with my potential. I
have thus liberated myself from a false want. This has nothing to do
with my worthiness.

I understand you are feeling lost, though consider the possibility
that this is in part because you yourself narrowed your options by
wanting only this path in your life. It does not mean that
alternatives do not exist or that you cannot be competent and valued
at something else. To be concrete, the notion that intellectual
curiosity is satisfied through a PhD programme is partially true but
also partially restricting: you can still be inquisitive, dubitative,
and sceptical without that formal capacity. It is the person who has
those qualities, not the role/title.

Several moons ago I wanted to follow the path that leads to the
academia. I was of the view that this was the natural telos of someone
with my kind of intellectual inclinations. For a variety of reasons
this did not happen. I was initially blaming myself, until I realised
this was a biased, narrow-minded perspective. Then I understood the
futility of this endeavour, of me criticising my ostensible
worthlessness, but also discerned it was a self-invigorating cycle: I
had developed tunnel vision by only wanting one outcome and then I was
feeling there is darkness all around when it was my tunnelling that
was causing it, not the surrounding reality actually being dark.

If you can find a job in the academia, do it. If not, muster the
courage to move on. Whatever the case, it will serve you well to
decouple the job-searching component of it from the intellectual
sensitivities you have. When you check the technicalities involved in
an academic's life, you may find lots of patterns that do not appeal
to you, such as the administrivia of everyday university matters and
the grinding business of scientific publishing. Even as a PhD, you
will be doing a job that may not necessarily fulfil you and, depending
on the specifics, may even reduce your enthusiasm for the things you
do like about that field.

By seeing every form of employment as employment, you will be able to
broaden your horizons. The stakes will be lower, because your
intellectual life and well-being will not depend on the job itself.
Whereas now they are all tied together in your mind and this can feel
overwhelming. "Normal" jobs will not deny you of your intelligence and
your innate curiosity. They may actually give you the opportunity to
take a step back from what you are used to, which can help you have a
more rounded understanding of your experience.

In my past, I did jobs like bartending and construction work. There is
nothing particularly "intellectual" about serving the Nth cocktail to
the drunks on the bar or carrying twenty kilos of concrete up and down
the stairs. Like every other kind of employment, these kept me going.
They also revealed to me aspects of human life I was not familiar with
and, by extension, helped me see the bigger picture in my life. I did
not become any less philosophical by doing such work. Maybe they are
not flattering on a CV, but this is a problem only if you think in
terms of the CV being the thing that flatters you instead of your
quality as a person, which others appreciate once they get to know
you.

Are these mutually exclusive? Can you not get some job now and
continue trying for a PhD? If you see these as an "either/or" kind of
deal, then you are forcing yourself to make an emotionally hard
decision. Compounding this is the incorrect notion that the PhD is the
sole conduit to intellectuality, so losing that is, understandably, a
really big problem.

Here I want to point out a tendency we have with matters we hold dear.
We identify with our pet projects/ideas/plans to the point where we
think that if we lose them, we lose our self in the process. Again,
this raises the stakes too high and makes every decision extremely
difficult. But why insist on that kind of association? Why make our
sense of self and of our concomitant wellness hinge on something we
cannot control? Why can we not be more adaptable, preserving the
kernel of quality we have while trying to make it fit in evolving
states of affairs? What if, for instance, your skills are valuable in
some industrial or entrepreneurial context? Maybe there is something
there that you will eventually like, even if it now seems unappealing
due to how invested you are in your current goal.

I think we can adapt and can find fulfilment even in
places/employment/people we would never have thought of as possible
before. To do this, we need to take a step back from the fray, allow
other experiences to unfold, and not insist on the "all or nothing"
kind of deal that is our singular present desire. There are too many
possibilities in this world and it is a pity to not appreciate any of
them because of some long-preconceived aspiration.

Yes, this is disheartening. Though, again, there can be many plausible
explanations for this phenomenon. It does not prove that you are
worthless (nor that they are worthy for that matter). Maybe they get
those positions because their particular area of interest is more
marketable or happens to have more vacancies. Maybe they get those
positions because the college needs to meet some quota of social
inclusivity. Or maybe there is some form of collusion or
discrimination involved.

You will never be certain of what the cause is. Better withhold
judgement about it and open yourself up to whatever possibilities life
brings you. If you conclude that all this is happening for the one and
only reason that you are supposedly not worthy, then I think you are
being simplistic and ultimately wrong.

Finally, I imagine there is also a sense of pride involved. Like what
you will tell your family and friends back home. This is a source of
pressure, for sure, though consider how you will be inviting scrutiny
if you dwell too much on this point, keep being apologetic about it,
and continue beating yourself up for it. Sometimes things do not work
out the way we had planned. And sometimes we lack the requisite
perspective to appreciate the little things that end up being more
important to us than whatever lofty targets we were originally aiming
at.

Good luck with everything and remember to take it easy!
