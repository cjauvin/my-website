The following is an exchange of views with Dragos Iorgulescu which took
place in the comments' section of my video about [Cosmos and
Logos](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-02-05-cosmos-logos-living-universe/)
(2022-02-05).  I am publishing it with permission.

Thank you Dragos for taking the time to share your thoughts!

The laws of physics are definitely a part of this.  And yes, other
animals have the propensities you have described: there are lots of
stories where we can clearly tell that the animals are closer to us than
we think.  Whatever differences must be of degree.

To broaden the subject a bit from the specifics of religiosity, and
speaking from experience, I have seen it with dogs who mourn the loss of
one of their own.  Or a dog that understands when it is separated from
its human.  A few years ago I had to stay in Germany for a few months:
when I returned my dog was so happy that he ran around the area (a
mountain) barking in joy, as if to inform everyone of the good news---I
have never seen anything like it (and my dog is not overly expressive).

Furthermore, I have seen how trees have notions of society and
solidarity.  For example, I sometimes spot small trees that grow under
the shadow of larger ones: they cannot get direct exposure to the Sun
themselves so they must be fed by the elder trees.  Plus we know of
symbiosis or synergies between trees and mycelium (related to mushrooms)
and bushes and insects.  They all understand sophisticated concepts such
as separation of concerns and division of labour.  Maybe they don't
reason about them the way we do, yet they still behave in accordance
with them.

Speaking of trees, if the ground under the tree has collapsed, forcing
it to lean sideways, you can observe how the tree understands what the
potential---the potential!---problem is: if it continues to grow on a
straight line, it will eventually collapse under its own weight.  What
it does instead is channel its vitality skyward, so it redirects to new
branches.  The old ones which once looked towards the sky but now point
sideways slowly wither away.  This is effectively the same as "course
correction", which shifts the balance of the tree towards the new
equilibrium.

If they have evident embedded knowledge of such concepts, can they have
knowledge that is communicated and recalled at future points?  And can
they think of their past and project into the future?  If not, why not
and are we certain of it?

To your question about where we go wrong (which I will elaborate in a
future video).  Humans have several facets to their existence.  We
analyse them, without implying that they have a standalone presence:
there is the mind or reason, the body with its mechanisms and
propensities, the emotions.  These are all interdependent: subsystems of
the supersystem we understand as "the human organism" (which itself is a
subsystem of the ecosystem, etc.).  The mind is affected by the body,
such as how we cannot think effectively when we are sick.  The body
influences emotions, just like how malnutrition or poor sleep keeps us
demotivated and can contribute to depression (among others).  The mind
triggers emotions, such as how a philosophical thought brings
excitement, which then has a noticeable effect on the body where, for
example, we can no longer sleep and suddenly have the energy and desire
to think things through.  And so on.

My point with this is that we have a fourth facet as well which is not
as developed as the others (the body is the most developed, as it is
almost mechanistic): this fourth facet is our mystical side (see
definition below).  Without training, we are guided by the instinct of
self-preservation so we are naturally disposed towards egocentrism: the
body conditions us.  But as we learn about the world, as our reason
takes form and our emotions can be aligned with our overall
mental/physical state, we understand that we are not the epicentre,
neither individually nor collectively: we are all parts of a greater
whole.  Humans, other animals, plants, planets, particles...  All are
parts of the greater whole.  In this sense, the mystical is that aspect
of our self which, paradoxically, helps us escape from the perception of
selfhood as self-centred-ness: it lets us see the bigger picture, if you
will.

[ "Mystery", "mysticism", etc. do not mean "strange" or "secret", but
  that which involves "introduction to" (i.e. "knowledge of") a given
  theme.  In this case the oneness of the world.  Sure, without
  knowledge something will appear strange or obscure, but the nuance
  matters because it is not inherently strange/obscure---we just lack an
  understanding of it.  "Myth" is related to "mystery" but more on that
  later. ]

Wars but also everyday squabbles are reducible to egoism (without
discounting the importance of political/social/economic/historical
analysis).  Those who can see the bigger picture understand that there
are alternatives.  There is a political extension to this, but let's
leave it for another time.

As for the Linux/Emacs stuff, I keep hacking every day.  I will also
give a talk at LibrePlanet 2022 but more on that when the time nears.

All the best from the mountains of Cyprus!
