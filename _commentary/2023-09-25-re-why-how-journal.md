What follows is an excerpt from a private exchange that I am sharing
with the express permission of my correspondent, without publishing
their identity.  It is a series of questions about my journaling
habits.  The quoted parts (which appeared indented on my website) are
from my correspondent.

Sure, I will answer.  If you agree, I can publish this part of the
exchange, without disclosing your identity.  What do you think?

> 1. Why do you journal?

It is one of the many routines I have to practice discipline.  I find it
beneficial to maintain habits that require upkeep; habits which create
accountability structures to keep me in check, while providing me with
the motivation to do something instead of nothing.

The journal is an outlet for my thinking.  I pick a topic and expound on
it.  Its specifics seldom matter.  My goal is to write well and
elucidate my thoughts, without jumping between unrelated subjects.  I
express my creativity in one go---"alla prima" to borrow a concept from
the history of painting---as I find it more satisfying and authentic.  I
tend to stay focused for longer when I go with the flow without losing
momentum.  Otherwise, I get bored when something appears easy and lose
interest.

The alla prima method gives me a reason to improve myself, as it leaves
no margin for major mistakes.  If I err, I live with it and that is
wonderful.  I learn from my mistakes by being honest about them and
value them as much as everything I do.

Perhaps the journal does not capture this authenticity the way my public
videos do (e.g. on philosophy), though the mechanics are the same.  I
know I did not defy my own rules, which is what discipline is about
(following the rules of another is "obedience").

> 2. Do you journal by hand or typing? Why, and why not?

I do it on the computer (with Emacs and my `denote` package, if that
matters).  The reason is that it is easier for me to keep a record of
everything.  My life has been too unstable to maintain physical
writings.  They take up space, which is a problem when you relocate
frequently...

Besides, I like to challenge myself: the computer can be a source of
distractions, as everything you can think of in the moment is a few
clicks away.  So I choose to journal on the computer to prove to myself
that I can remain in control.

Not to sound obsessed though: I only journal when I feel like it.  For
me, the most important quality in every expression is its honesty: it
has to come about organically.  Otherwise, I will be mindlessly
performing rituals, like daily journaling, whose ulterior end I
forgot.

I write in English, with few exceptions.  It is easier to search the
contents of files.  In Greek we have accents on vowels, which make
searches a bit more cumbersome.  For example, a search for `Πρωτεσίλαος`
does not match any among `ΠΡΩΤΕΣΙΛΑΟΣ`, `πρωτεσιλαος`, `Πρωτεσιλαος`.
Granted, this is minor issue, but it still bothers me when the program
does not do what I expect.  I have thought about writing without
accents, or with full capital letters, though each of these workarounds
comes with its own considerable problems.  A better alternative is to
produce the requisite code that interprets vowels with and without
accents.  I have had no time for it---maybe one day in the near future.
Until then, I opt for English.

I type everything, as I explained above.
