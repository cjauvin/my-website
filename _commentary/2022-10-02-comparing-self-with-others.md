I think comparisons are inevitable.  Part of our nature is to mimic
patterns of behaviour.  At a basic level, this mechanism helps us learn
new things and also adapt to the specifics of the given situation.

To compare and to mimic becomes a problem when it contradicts our
actuality.  This happens if we try to be someone else against our
characteristics.  For example, I am an introvert and have great
difficulty doing what a very extroverted person does with ease (and they
can't easily do what is normal for me).

When we try to be someone else contrary to our reality, we always notice
the distinction between who we are and what we want.  We do not compare
favourably to it.  We then start belittling ourselves for not being good
enough or, worse, for being an utter failure of a human being.  In
simple terms, we become our own worst enemy.

What causes us to deny or hate our self is the development of tunnel
vision.  For instance, you are comparing yourself to other students in
terms of grades and the relevant performance.  You are focused on the
engineering part of it with an emphasis on how it is done in the class.
When we focus on one point in this way, we tend to aggrandise it: we
give it too much value as we think it is the centre of the universe.  In
simple terms, we say "either I have THAT or I have nothing."

If left unchecked, this tunnel vision turns into an obsession.  We want
that single thing we are focusing on and we lose sight of the bigger
picture.  We forget that there is so much more to life than the object
of our desire.  Again, this links back to self denial and self-hatred as
we tend to discount or altogether dismiss our qualities.  For example,
the student with the perfect grades may not be a funny or interesting
person outside the specifics of engineering/studying, whereas you might
be that.  There are so many aspects to one's individuality.  Reducing
ourselves to one or a few of them ends up being a form of dogma against
us.  It is like an unfair judgement of "if you don't have a perfect
score, you are nothing!"  If you obsess with a given point, you ignore
those other aspects of your self that make you who you are and for which
others might like you.

We use the expression "our obsessions" or "my obsession".  It implies
that we own it and we can basically do whatever we want with it.  Though
if you think about how it actually works, the obsession controls us.  It
conditions our behaviour, as everything we do is in the service of that
object of desire we have.  Taken to the extreme, obsessions force us to
deny our self and to sacrifice what we have.

Having good grades is fine.  What matters though, is that we do not
measure our worth as a human being with such a one-size-fits-all
instrument.  It simply is the wrong method.  We must consider our case,
and every case, in light of its particularities.  You have qualities
that make you unique.  These may not match with what you are now doing
because, maybe, you still need to learn more about who you really are.

As we learn more about who we are, we start accepting the world as it
is.  We take what we have for what it is, without apologising for it.
This means that we are no longer worried about how we compare to others.
We free ourselves from that constant pressure.  I am not implying that
this is easy, as there are all sorts of social expectations in life that
want us to be this or that.  The idea is that accepting our actuality,
coming to terms with our condition, has a benign longer-term effect on
us.  We are more calm.  Then we notice how many of the people we once
admired are actually not at peace with who they are: they keep faking it
and are dying on the inside.

Try to widen that tunnel vision by wondering if good grades, possibly
followed by a lucrative career, are worth a life of perpetual stress and
self-denial.  We are raised to think that more money and prestige is
always good for us.  But this ignores the underlying person.  We all
have different rhythms.  If we ignore them for too long, we suffer.
When we reach a critical point, we pray for things to be different.  We
wish we could go back in time to tell our past self to have a sense of
the bigger picture, to learn to appreciate what they have, and to not
let their obsessions control them.
