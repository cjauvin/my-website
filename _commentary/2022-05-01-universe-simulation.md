title: "Further thoughts on the universe as simulation"
excerpt: "An exchange of views on the idea that our universe may be a simulation."
---

What follows is part of an email exchange with a person named Hanspeter
that I am sharing with permission.  The full identity of my
correspondent shall not be revealed.

This discussion started as a comment on my previous publication [About
the world as simulation](https://protesilaos.com/commentary/2022-03-06-cosmos-simulation/)
(2022-03-06) which itself was an aside on my presentation about [Cosmos,
Logos, and the living universe](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-02-05-cosmos-logos-living-universe/) (2022-02-05).

This publication consists of three parts, which reflect the flow of the
correspondence.

I see your point and agree with it.  We would just need to discern those
patterns---follow the hints, as it were---and reach the appropriate
conclusion.  The implication is that this simulated world could contain
the relevant pointers on whether it is a simulation inside a simulation,
so we could "escape" recursively.  If we could not escape recursively,
then we would not be able to identify these "required feature(s)" that
you mention and our endeavour would be left incomplete.

Shall I then add to your view this recursive aspect?  Or am I
misunderstanding it and going in the wrong direction?

Assuming I can work with this hypothesis, at some point we will be out
of the simulation.  For now let's limit this exit to the realm of the
thinkable (a physical escape is an interesting concept as well, but I
think we would need to consider a plausible mechanism that would
transfer us "there"---we can discuss this, though I am just noting it
here without further comments).

Once we are outside the simulation (or simulation of simulations) we are
present in the same plane of existence as the simulation master.  Put
differently, we are in the locus where the simulation runs in.  In my
article I referred to this place as "originary plane of reality" though
we can describe it using different terms, if you want.

So far everything falls within our means of comprehension, which can be
applied recursively to all planes of reality.  Which brings me back to
the question that prompted my publication (which was in response to my
presentation on [Cosmos, Logos, and the living
universe](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-02-05-cosmos-logos-living-universe/)):

> Thanks for sharing your thoughts about the Cosmos. [...] Have you
> heard about the theory that the universe may be a simulation?  How
> would that affect your ideas?

The terms "cosmos" or "universe" may be causing confusion here because
of how they are used in other contexts.  If so, I apologise for not
being clear.  For example, we have the notion of a "parallel universe",
hence a plurality of universes.  What is implied in my publications
though, is that even this potential multitude forms part of a greater
whole, else a totality of actual and potential states.  In Greek the
word for universe is "synpan" (or "symban").  The terms "syn" and "pan"
mean all (pan) together or combined (syn).  [The original meaning of
"universe"](https://www.etymonline.com/word/universe) is similar: "[all]
turned into one".  Again, we have a totality.

We thus have this greater whole which encompasses the simulation and the
originary plane of reality where the simulation runs in.  This totality,
I claim, still has structure, pattern, order, and hence reason and
language (i.e. Logos).  We can understand as much even if we have
physically not been "there".  In other words, all this falls within our
means of comprehension by virtue of that recursive capacity I outlined.

I then use this comment to draw a parallel with theology and argue
against a view that theologians in my part of the world hold where God
is supposed to be beyond our comprehension (a monk told me as much a
while ago).  They only invoke this point when they are pressed to
provide answers to difficult questions.  Taking it at face value, I must
then say that if God is truly beyond our comprehension, then it means
that our comprehension has a robust terminus.  And if such a terminus
exists, whatever revelation by God will necessarily have to fall inside
those boundaries.  Otherwise we cannot make sense of it: we cannot see
or hear it, so to speak (though please take this as a metaphor and not
tell me that we could just use some specialised equipment---the use of
equipment still falls within our means of comprehension).  In other
words, God would not be able to (i) keep us in our current condition and
(ii) also reveal to us something about His true nature which is beyond
our comprehension: either the revelation would be about something we
could ultimately discover ourselves, or it would be decisively
unintelligible or incomprehensible for us and hence would constitute no
revelation whatsoever.

The world-as-simulation is a proxy in this regard.  The simulation
master has a presence outside or beyond the simulation.  If that reality
is comprehensible, then we can understand everything about the
simulation master by tracing those patterns, as you hinted at.  If,
however, the simulation master has an aspect to their being which we
cannot grasp, then we would be unable to prove their claims that they
genuinely have a presence beyond our comprehension.

If God is beyond our comprehension and God reveals Himself to us in His
incomprehensible dimension, we will simply not notice that which is
being revealed.  If, however, the theologians are wrong and God is
comprehensible throughout, then revelations are mere shortcuts.  In this
latter case, whether we live in a simulation or not changes nothing in
the grand scheme of things, because we can recursively "get out" of it
and still grasp the same features of the immanent Logos.

To conclude, I think your suggestion is consistent with my thinking.  My
idea is that God is comprehensible, that a recursive escape from a
potential simulation is possible, and that such an escape does not
change my view that Logos is everywhere in the totality (in the Cosmos).
I am, however, sceptical of the significations and narratives associated
with the term "revelation" due to what I wrote above: if God is
comprehensible, then the revelation is a mere shortcut, kind of how we
get the answers to an exam, but if the revelation is supposed to reveal
something beyond our comprehension, then it is futile.

- I think, a 'universal' capability to 'step out' recursively of 'all'
  simulations can not be inferred from a potential possibility, that
  this would be the case for our direct simulation ancestors.

  What I mean is this:
  On a higher level plane of reality/simulation (outside our 'simulation'),
  the afore mentioned 'features' rendering it possible to proof our
  reality being a simulation (and perhaps making it even possible to
  step out of it somehow) needn't necessarly exist, even if our direct
  'outsides' (ancestor simulations) provide those features.

  I.e. recursion is not transitive in such a situation; it is
  transitive fully back to the 'root' plane only, if 'every' simulation
  contains these required 'features'.

- the question whether we can expect or even reason that we would
  finally *have to* find proof that we live inside some simulation - if
  this really was the case perhaps may be anwered quite simply?

  If there really exists some 'simulation master' on a higher plane und
  creating us by its simulation, then there has to be a 'connection'
  between the masters reality and our own. Because some kind of
  connection (channel) is always required to transfer matter, energy,
  information or even some higher order construct. Without such a
  connection, the whole simulation would make no sense, as the
  simulation itself (and the results provided by it) would be perdu to
  the simulation master. So from this point of view, perhaps, we can
  infere, that, IF we actually live(d) inside a simulation and there
  actually IS some kind of connection to the simulation master, THEN it
  MUST be possible, to get proof for it, no?

- I think an actual phyiscal transfer of ourselves to some meta
  simulation / reality would require that such a one would feature the
  very same physical laws as our reality - this would imply the
  'simulation master' inhabits some parallel / peer universe of ours
  and not some meta universe.

  In the case of the meta universe variant, I would assume that the
  physical laws have to be different to ours and thus a physical exit
  from our reality to this meta reality would not be feasible. Some
  kind of mental transfer of ourselves into some kind of meta-avatar -
  however - would seem feasible.

- I agree fully with you:
  God being beyond our comprehension is an admission for our failing to
  understand and grasp him.

- What motivation would God have to set such a terminus (as you call
  it) on our capabilities? This makes no sense for a 'true' God.
  A true God does not have to fear anything (e.g. us understanding him)
  and he would not want to cripple our capabilities; because he would
  want that everything 'grows'.

- I think this comprehension beyond the simulation (of the things
  outside the simulation) requires some connection between the outside
  and the inside of the simulation. Such a connection would be
  bidirectional; as the simulation master (the simulation's inhabitants
  God?), interacts with the simulation's content, i.e. he feeds
  information into it and gets information out of it.  Because this is
  the case, this would have to allow also the simulation's inhabitants
  (us) to reach outside and thus to 'experience' God.  (see above)

- nicely put - yes, I agree.

Indeed.  I was getting ahead of myself.  Though keep a mental note about
this point as I connect it with the following one to explain why I did
so.

The reason I jumped to the early conclusion of the recursive capacity to
discern an "exit" to the simulation is what you describe here.  Again,
this reflects how I think of "universe" in its original sense of
all-as-one and not in the sense of "our plane of existence" with its
potential parallels or supersets.  As such, I was thinking that there
eventually has to be a connection between all these planes of existence
which I consider it to be the immanence of pattern, structure, ratio,
reason (as causality and logic) and language (i.e. Logos).  The reason I
have to assume Logos as ubiquitous or ever-present is because the human
condition renders it impossible to consider its alternative, which is
Chaos: the absolute lack of pattern, structure, order.

When it comes to absolutes such as Chaos or Nothingness (Non-Being), we
can only describe them in negative terms, as the opposite of that which
we can comprehend.  We cannot grasp them directly.  The very moment we
reason about Nothingness and describe it in some way, we are inevitably
substantiating it as Somethingness.  Same for Chaos which, once reasoned
about, is rendered as non-Chaos for it mentally acquires some structure
(by describing it, we necessarily discern a pattern in it).

[ Hopefully this makes sense and I don't sound confusing. ]

You are nonetheless correct that insofar as the simulation is concerned,
the aforementioned recursion is not necessary.  For it to be so, the
simulation of simulations would have to be complete to the point where
it would not be distinguishable in terms of its inner features from the
reality it simulates.  In the case of incompleteness, there exists the
possibility that the simulation lacks the capabilities we covered
earlier about us having the potential to recognise it as a simulation or
the ability to do so recursively.

If we assume completeness, as I did, then we do not have to trust the
word of the simulation master at face value: we can ultimately verify it
ourselves and continue with our inquiry into the world from there.

If, however, the simulation is incomplete, then we might have to believe
the simulation master's (this simulation's or its parent simulation and
so on) claims without having the means to establish them as facts.  In
this regard, I would reach the same conclusion I did in my original
publication, namely that we can only do so by performing a leap of faith
as we reach a terminus or by remaining sceptical (further below I
comment on the concept of a terminus).

Generalising this further: in the case of completeness, then yes we can
experience God directly.  I even think that all forms of being in the
universe (in the all-as-one sense) are consubstantial in that they all
partake in the Logos.  There are differences of degree, not substance,
meaning that there can be no forms which are non-Logos as a form
presupposes pattern, structure, et cetera.  This, however, means that
God cannot be exocosmic, outside this totality I mentioned, but simply
cosmic or else part and parcel of the Cosmos (the all-as-one totality),
ultimately as its underlying structure.  Though this view of the divine
differs from that of the simulation master, because the latter is
external to the simulation, whereas the deity here is inseparable from
the totality.

The terminus makes sense in the case of incompleteness that I outlined
earlier.  It is built-in and inescapable.

The term could also be used as a means of describing our current
potential.  Though it would be inaccurate.  What I mean is that the
"terminus" can refer to our present condition as one of those
"differences of degree" that I noted in the previous paragraph: it is
not that we cannot understand the Logos in all of its emanations, but
that we remain in a process of continuous research, discovery, thinking,
or evolution more broadly.  As such, the "terminus" is but an
intermediate state of affairs and must thus not be understood as a
terminus: I would prefer to use a different word.

Finally, the terminus can mean the outer boundaries of the universe
(all-as-one) once we factor in its ultimate potential.  Though here we
have an interesting problem.  Does the universe have boundaries and, if
it does, how can it possibly be this "totality" I have been mentioning?
And if it has boundaries, what is that which borders or encompasses it?
Whatever it is, it must still be part of a set and the set of all sets
is that which is the totality.  Which brings us back to the original
meaning of the universe which implies it is boundless (whether our
universe qua plane of existence has boundaries is entirely possible, as
it might exist in some relation with other such planes, yet they too
must all form a totality).

This brings me back to how this exchange started with the first
publication I posted on my website and you quoting this part from it:

> We lack the capacity to verify whether this world is a simulation or
> not because we cannot think beyond what the universe renders possible.

That is an excerpt of my view where I entertain the hypothesis that God
is incomprehensible in some ways and how such a thesis works against
those who propound it (as I noted earlier about revelations).

Here I expand on what I think without doing it in a roundabout way: a
continuation of my presentation on Cosmos/Logos.
