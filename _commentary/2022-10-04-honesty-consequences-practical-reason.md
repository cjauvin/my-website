What follows is an exchange that is related to the various remarks I
have made about being honest with oneself and on honesty in general.

Hello there!  I think your approach is correct, given the constraints.
The principle is to apply practical reason and to know what the
situation allows for.  Being honest here means that you do not
overestimate your power.  Put simply, one must learn to pick their
battles.

You are making a sincere effort of giving up some of your comfort or
wellness for the good of your loved ones.  That is honourable!  Based
on what you wrote, you have no doubt that you are labouring under an
uneven balance of power: there is little you can do and no viable
alternative is available.

There is a parallel here to the story of Ulysses (Odysseus) who was
travelling back home but got shipwrecked on an island where a one-eyed
giant lived: a cyclops.  The cyclops took Ulysses and his crew captive
and was planning to eat them.  Our hero would be foolish if he were to
challenge the giant to a one-on-one fight.  Such a battle would lead
to the demise of Ulysses.  Instead, the plan was to wait patiently for
the right opportunity to escape from the cyclops' cave, fainting
weakness in the meantime.

You are in a similar situation.  Trapped in the cave of some ruthless
giant.  This cyclops has one eye that only sees the good of the
business.  The well-being of its people is, at best, secondary to
that.  So the giant treats you as replaceable.  You basically are a
cog to them.  Maybe an expansive one, but a spare part nonetheless.

Practical reason has given you the answer which you are already
applying: stick to what you are doing for the good of your loved ones.
Though try to search for alternatives.  Maybe there are ways to ease
the pressure on you without compromising on your priorities towards
your family.  Conserve as much of your energy as you can and keep the
fire alive.

Ultimately though, this is why I talked in a recent video about the
"private and the political".  Many magnitudes in our human world are
outside the control of any individual.  We are always confined to the
rules of a certain setting (the video is ~1 hour long, but this is the
idea).  As such, I am realistic in my thinking and know that many
things will not come about easily due to structural constraints
(i.e. even if we have the right attitude as individuals).

explain more, if you need.
