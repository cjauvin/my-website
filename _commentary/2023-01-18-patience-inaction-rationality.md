What follows is an excerpt from a private exchange.  I comment on some
of the themes I have covered in my publications on philosophy.  The
quoted/indented parts are from my correspondent.  The identity of the
person remains private and I have received permission to share this.

An excuse to philosophise has to be among my favourite excuses.  Haha!

I will answer this and the following questions.  Can I publish your
quotes and my comments on them?  I will not disclose your personal
details.

I think you already have the answer as you mention "to reach a goal".
This means that your actions are purposeful.  While you can parse them
in a stepwise way as a series of small tasks, you understand that they
all contribute in concert to a greater end.  Doing something with
purpose is the same as walking on a long road through the mountains
from village A to village B.  You cannot teleport there and you can't
sprint for such a long distance either.  You are aware that the
journey will take several hours and you know that being impatient will
make you feel tired, even if your body has stamina left.  The way to
withstand the pressure and overcome the challenges is to focus on the
here-and-now: enjoy your surroundings and pay attention to whatever it
is you are doing or thinking in the moment.  Time flies by and you
keep going, until you eventually reach your destination.  This
encapsulates the idea of patience.

You rightly mention the status quo.  Is patience leading to
conformism?  I think the answer is affirmative only if the goal is to
be a conformist, such as to persevere at an awful job because of the
"social credibility" it offers you.  It is not patience that preserves
the status quo, but the willingness to uphold it either out of fear or
some calculated benefit or, generally, some other motivation.

Patience simply is a method of acting and thinking.  It is about our
disposition, else the way we relate to phenomena.  We combine a sense
of the longer-term goal or bigger picture with the minutiae of our
presence in the here-and-now.  We cannot have presence on its own, as
that will reduce our behaviour to a series of disjointed reactions.
We cannot have just the bigger picture either, as that will hold us
captive in a state of overthinking where we will continue to abstract,
to map, and to fathom all aspects of the concepts under consideration.
So we act with some sense of purpose---some imperfect or incomplete
plan in mind---while also being focused on the immediate step ahead.

There are times where we make compromises and endure whatever hardship
because we think it is to our longer-term benefit.  Here too patience
works the same way I outlined: it helps us get through the ordeal.
Though it is important to identify what brings us to this state of
affairs and to not misattribute it to patience per se.

More broadly, a revolutionary who wants to reform the established
order from the roots to its branches knows that the impetus for change
does not come on-demand and cannot be sustained on a whimsy.
Sometimes the revolution has to wait and be readied on the margins
until a more opportune moment arises.  In this case, we have the
ultimate objective of upsetting the status quo, but in the meantime we
appear to be in conformity with it (e.g. an anarchist who uses
fiat/state money to buy groceries even though they disagree with the
state in principle).

Based on these, impatience and pushing through are useful when we do
not have a reason to stick to the end goal.  Again, we have finite
resources and try to use them as best we can.  For instance, you are
about to catch the bus, but someone starts talking to you and is not
considerate with your time: it would be a mistake to be patient with
that person as you have something more important to do.

There are scenaria where patience is inapplicable.  Consider the case
of a bad relationship.  You tried to make it work but for whatever
reason you did not get what you wanted.  The communication channels
are broken and things can only deteriorate.  You have to find the
strength to quit.

Patience has to be couched in terms of reasonableness and of how our
emotional state affects our everyday functioning.  If the relationship
is abusive, for example, we will go through traumatic experiences.  We
already know how harmful those are.  We are not operating in a vacuum:
there is a shared stock of knowledge that we have access to.  If we
get that feeling of dread, we should know that it is time to admit
what the reality is and abort the project.

Patience then is not an excuse for insisting on an untenable
situation.  It also is not equivalent to stubbornness.  It is a method
that we employ when we want to achieve something.  When that goal is
no longer feasible, we have to shift our energy elsewhere, otherwise
risk sustaining permanent injury.

Since I already expounded on patience, I want to use these questions
to pivot to a different topic.  In our life, we try to have clarity:
to understand our thoughts better, to know who are our friends and
loved ones, to figure out what we like and dislike, et cetera.  Even
though we do not achieve perfect clarity, we still have an intuitive
understanding of what "clarity" means.  The fact that we do not
realise the ideal of clarity does not prevent from trying to
approximate it.  In other words, we use the ideal as our guide, the
lodestar that allows us to orientate ourselves in the wilderness.  We
can do this even without formalising it as "now I am pursuing my ideal
of clarity".  No, we do not need to formulate it this way and be
conscious of it.  We can do the right thing without ever noticing it.

I thus think that part of the argument against overthinking is that we
do not really know what the exact "right balance" is.  We can only
work towards it through a process of trial and error.  We are
fallible, our time is limited, and the issues obscure.  Many possible
outcomes can only be fully comprehended after they have transpired.
In a sense, we set a destination and continuously try to correct our
course based on the live feedback we receive, just like a ship
circumnavigating the globe.

Inactivity is not a problem as such.  Just as action for the sake of
action is not always inherently helpful.  We need to consider those in
terms of what they contribute to.  If they are purposeful, they are
part of a greater whole that adds meaning to them.

I think there is no definitive answer here.  Our best guess is to
accept and to tolerate a degree of error in our judgements.  Put
simply yet succinctly, let us recognise our humanity.  We do not have
the luxury to spend an eternity contemplating the propriety of every
idea, the precision of every concept, the scope of every notion.  Our
actuality is one of action.  We always act on the basis of imperfect
information and we always have to make decisions that preclude certain
possible outcomes.

Values and principles are helpful, though we must be careful not to
assign disproportionate trust to our mind's capacity to fathom those
themes.  There is always a chance that we are wrong, so while it is
fine to proceed from a position of principle, we must do it with the
understanding that we might be erring.  Don't turn your principles
into a dogma that must never be questioned.

I am of the view that relying exclusively on our reason is a mistake.
We reduce our multifaceted nature to a rationalist one.  Yet we know
we are not purely rational.  Trusting our senses and emotions can be
helpful as well.  We want to have a balance here as well.  There are
cases where the "gut feeling" or some dream state may be telling us
something that our reason cannot assess properly without further
information.  For a trivial example, consider how our body can tell us
about an intolerance to a certain type of food.  The given organ has
knowledge that we have yet to render clear in our conscience.  Or,
again, with the case of the toxic relationship where we feel bad
without having a proper explanation for every part of it.

Reason is a reliable faculty, though it also is the source of our
overthinking.  Therein lies the hint we need to accept ambiguity and
uncertainty as part of our life.  Sure, we have to do this as a form
of decision which inevitably is reasonable.  Though we are merely
using our reason to establish a connection with whatever lies outside
of it.

If something feels wrong, there is a good chance that it is indeed
wrong for us.  The "irrational doubt or fear" may be a coping
mechanism that contributes to our wellness.  So what if it is
irrational?  Think about all the processes in our body that keep us
alive.  Is a beating heart "rational", for example?  I think not.

I have learnt to take it easy.  Instead of trying to figure out the
best scheme for everything, I adopt the lifestyle of proceeding
through trial and error.  I have ideas that guide my action, though I
cannot tell with certainty that they are absolutely correct because my
ultimate criterion is the very being that may be fallible: me.

The absolutes are not our domain.  We have approximations of them in a
world that unfolds in action.  By accepting that the perfect does not
exist for us, we have a certain lightness to our being.  We are free
from that restraining, all-or-nothing attitude of the right idea, the
right meaning, the right purpose, etc.

Maybe I am wrong but the music is playing and I am on the dance floor
with no way out.  So I might as well dance and have a good time.

No need to apologise: you did nothing wrong.  Please let me know if I
can publish this.  Again, I will not disclose your details.
