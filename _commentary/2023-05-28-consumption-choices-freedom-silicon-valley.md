title: "Consumption choices and software freedom in Silicon Valley"
excerpt: "My reply on how to reconcile principles with practical considerations for a person working in Silicon Valley."

What follows is an excerpt from a recent private exchange that I am
sharing with the express permission of my correspondent.  The topic is
about practical adherence to principles in the midst of an indifferent
or uncooperative community.

The quoted/indented text is from the person I am responding to.

Freedom seldom is the most convenient choice.  Not just for software,
but life in general.  Think about an ideal democracy, for example: every
citizen has the responsibility to be informed about what is happening in
order to contribute to good policy-making.  It requires a lot of work
from everyone to keep a democracy healthy.  Whereas systems of
government that do not involve broad-based participation have fewer
requirements on what a person must do: if there is a problem, it is "the
government" that will fix it, not all of us together.  Tyranny can be
highly convenient for a lot of people.

When we opt in to free software, we do it because we care about the
freedom of it.  We want, for instance, not to be subject to the
telemetering of a proprietary software provider.  Freedom does not come
for free.  It requires sacrifices on our part.  This is not to justify
transient constraints with the accessibility of free software (e.g. lack
of good documentation), but to emphasise the trade-off between freedom
and convenience.

You operate in a milieu that embeds---and champions---the culture of
convenience in tech.  The idea that we should throw away our iThings
after 1-2 years of usage is normal there.  Trying to argue that there is
no inherent technical reason for this pace of change will make you stand
out as irregular or even a weirdo.  Not because you are wrong per se,
but simply due to the collective narrative that is prevalent there,
which you already hinted at with your reference to social
rituals/signaling.

A note on the word "normal" that I used.  It refers to something that
happens with regularity but also to what is desired to happen.  When
someone tells you to "act normal", what they really mean is that you
*should* conform with whatever set of values the predominant group
adheres to.

The key, then, is not to find free software that is hyper convenient but
to settle on a balance between freedom and convenience that is practical
and sustainable for you.  It is a matter of how you feel about it and
what your outlook is.  This means that you have to (i) tolerate whatever
awkwardness exists in the usage of free software and (ii) do what is
expected of you without going to the extreme of consumerism.  Put
differently, do not think in terms of absolutes: try to move towards
freedom, with the recognition that it will be unlikely to go all the
way.

On the topic of embarrassment.  It may be because you have not yet
figured how to guard against the subtle bullying of "I told you so" that
you are exposed to.  Sure, they may not be beating you up, but constant
pressure to conform still has the effect of denying you agency.  The
answer to this is to stand firm in your choices.  You can only do so
when you have clarity as to the "why" you are pursuing such a course of
action.  If somebody asks you in earnest what's so special about
software freedom, you will have to give a persuasive answer.  If not,
then you simply look strange and others will continue to pressure you.

To figure out the "why" of free software, you must try to sort out your
priorities in life and resolve whatever tensions therein.  You have to
reach a point where you are not apologetic of what you choose/do.  If
you find yourself in a mode of behaviour where you are always sorry for
doing this or that, then you have yet to achieve the requisite clarity
of mind as to the "why" you are doing it.

Right now, free software appears to many as the bastion of computer
geeks/nerds.  For people like you, this stereotype is stigmatising and
inconvenient, because it highlights technicalities over universal
values.  It is up to you to conduct yourself in an affirmative way that
dispels this stigma and shows that you can be "productive" without
having to resort to frivolous spending.

Those granted, you can already tell that your social environment frames
and conditions your actions.  Do not expect anyone to show sympathy with
your cause.  You will find detractors or, generally, be faced with
apathy.  What matters is whether you choose to continue making the
choices you consider right.  This depends on whether you can overcome
the feelings of embarrassment and are able to let your deeds do the
talking.

Should we be optimistic, given what we know about Silicon Valley?
Perhaps not, though we ought to remember that decent people exist
everywhere.  Just as you are pressured to behave in a certain way, so is
everybody else.  We cannot expect ideal conditions and dealings with
angels.  All we have to work with is imperfect human beings within the
equally imperfect institutional arrangements they have set up.  We have
to start from somewhere and work towards enacting reform, one small step
at a time.  Courage is contagious.
