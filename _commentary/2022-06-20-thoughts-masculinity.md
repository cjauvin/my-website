I will get to the answer but must first comment on the framing of your
question.  I understand English may not be your mother tongue, as it
isn't mine, and am not judging you for it.  This is just a general
remark on matters of method and disposition.  Please don't take it
personally.

Your question starts with the hidden assumption that "we", meaning men,
are "more feminine".  It holds the belief that this state of affairs is
undesirable and that "we" should do something about it.  The implied
ostensible relative increase in levels of femininity among men suggests
that there existed an earlier era when men were not feminine.  Finally,
it lumps up together a diverse group of people as "men", thus reducing
them to a homogeneous set.

The questions we pose foreshadow the answers we receive or the findings
we collect.  If you think that the above hidden beliefs are true, you
are inclined to favour answers that support your narrative.  Let me then
tell you that I am sceptical of the premise of this question.  Some
observations:

* How do you measure masculinity?  Is it a natural condition, a bundle
  of social expectations, something else?

* If masculinity is on a spectrum from, say, 0-100 then the supposed
  homogeneous set that includes all men isn't that homogeneous after
  all.  There is a great deal of variety therein.  Why then lump
  together a diverse group of people and tell them that some are more
  true than others?

* If forced homogenisation is somehow the goal, what should be the
  target on this fabled masculinity index?  50?  A 100?  If your score
  is 5 points below, what shall we do with you?  What about a deviation
  of 10 points?  And then 20?  Where do we draw the line?

* If masculinity is a spectrum and if, for the sake of this discussion,
  femininity is its opposite, we would be justified to believe it is a
  spectrum as well.  We then have the same methodological problems for
  this group of people.

Without even mentioning other genders, you can already tell that the
constructs of masculine and feminine are relative as they exist on a
continuum.  Otherwise the very notions of "less feminine" and "more
masculine" would be meaningless.  It would be a binary of either you are
or you are not.  There would be no hard methodological problems to
solve.  You would just draw a clear distinction between only two
possibilities.

From these alone, we start realising that your question undermines the
neat separation between the masculine and the feminine.  Either you
believe in the binary, in which case phenomena such as "less feminine"
are impossible, or you accept the presence of a spectrum and thus
discard simplistic concepts of the "manly man" and the like.  Once we
add the fact of the gender spectrum to our consideration, we notice that
the original thesis is untenable, but I will not delve further as you
may need more time to think about it.

Now on to the link you provided.  I did not watch the whole video.
Sorry!  I stopped a bit before the 4th minute as I already had all the
information I needed.  I have heard the same things a hundred times over
in my own cultural milieu.  In those few minutes I watched there were
references to some cult that presumably comprises all those dube-bros,
the image of a pernicious "Adonis" meme, as well as undertones of
homophobia and, perhaps, misogyny.  Furthermore, there was the
all-too-familiar mischaracterisation of emotions as (i) a sign of
weakness and (ii) a mark of femininity.

Starting from that last element, I know from the numerous
backward-minded people in my own culture how, for example, appreciating
the sunset, reciting poetry, and admiring paintings are all signs you're
gay.  I pity the covertly insecure "manly man" who does not appreciate a
sunset and is afraid to engage with art!

Families with a son and daughter will send the boy to study physics and
the girl literature.  Is it because the former is that much smarter?
No.  It simply has to do with stereotypes and what effectively is sheer
folly.  (And I won't even go into the widespread bias against the
humanities.)

People suffer from the collective obsession to have defined roles for
everyone.  If you don't quite fit in to the mould, they will offend you,
ridicule you for being less of this or that, and ultimately bully you
into submission.  Instead of treating you as a fully fledged human
being, they objectify you into what basically is a smart sex doll.

It does not stop with gender though.  These attitudes are totalitarian
at their core, as they extend to every expression of individuality and
are ultimately intolerant of everything that departs from their desired
normality.  Religion, political views, skin colour, ethnic background...
Or do you think that someone who is of a mindset that distinguishes
between "real" and "fake" men will hesitate to apply the same reasoning
to other matters, given the right triggers?

I am of the view that there is no such thing as a true specimen on a
spectrum.  There may be an average or a more common occurrence of a
pattern under certain circumstances, but none is more truthful than the
others.  Set gender issues aside for a moment.  Would the idea of a
"true" skin colour make you feel comfortable?  I hope not.  Put
differently, I do not subscribe to the view that there is a man manquÃ©
and that the idea of a "real man" is but codetalk for enforcing a
specific view.

Furthermore, I do not agree with the very construct of a unidimensional
person, where you are either identified by others or forced to thus
identify yourself as merely a gender.  We are so much more than a
pronoun and/or a sexual organ.

This leads me to the point in the video's introduction where some Adonis
fellow is mentioned and a meme is on display.  You may be interested in
a relevant reply I provided to the question of [Why greek gods are
represented as
naked](https://protesilaos.com/commentary/2022-06-09-re-greek-gods-naked/),
specifically the part about fitness:

Now think about the implicit comparison between modern men and some
legendary era of yore during which men where true to form.  Are we
talking about any specific dates?  Can you show me who those real men
were?  Do we know anything about how they actually felt?  Is there any
data about domestic abuse and/or the kind of suffering that older
generations would actively suppress?

Many of these narratives of a long-lost golden age gain their
superficial plausibility from a basic misunderstanding regarding the
interpretation of the fact that we have abundant evidence about
contemporary matters.  They find no such evidence for older times and
thus reach the false conclusion that its absence is proof that people
were leading happy lives.  For example, elderly folks will tell you how
couples are decadent nowadays because there were practically no divorces
back then.  What they conveniently ignore is that women had no equal
rights at the time, were treated like financial assets by their parents
who would essentially sell them to the highest bidder, were faced with
open hostility to challenge the status quo, and had no economic
independence.  Of course what we have today is different because the
prevailing conditions have changed.  The real question is if all
marriages in those old days were happy ones.  I doubt it.

If there is one message to extract from my reply let it be this: instead
of wondering why men are "more feminine", ask if we all can do
something, individually and collectively, to broaden our understanding
of the human condition.  Why obsess about sex and gender when there is
so much more to what makes us human?  Can we find a midpoint, where we
contribute to all facets of our humanity without going to extremes?
