The following is an excerpt from a recent exchange where I respond to
my correspondent's questions about living without clinging on to
obsessions about rewards, recognition, et cetera.  The text is shared

Maybe "cessation of the mind" will yield the desired results, though I
am of a different view.  Let me gradually unpack it for you.

Let's start with recognition.  I think we can simplify things by
saying that there are things we like in their own right and things we
want for what they bring to us.

- For example, I like hiking and walking long distances.  I do this
  privately (me and my dog or me alone): there is no audience to
  congratulate me for my endurance and reward me for my tenacity.  I
  do it because I like it and don't care if anyone is watching and/or
  if I will gain something more out of it that is not pertinent to it
  (e.g. fame and wealth is not inherent to walking).  I talk about
  this to make a point, as I have explained in my various
  philosophical videos where I walk and talk.  I do not mention it to
  brag about it.

- Contrary to this we have something like the pursuit of followers on
  social media.  We go for a high score.  There is no inherent worth
  to the number 100 or 10000 or however many added zeroes: its value
  is relative to what our peers have or what finds currency as
  "success" in our circle.  If the perceived competitor has an order
  of magnitude higher than us, we feel empty even if we have a million
  followers.

The difference between the two is one of disposition: how do I feel
about it.  If I go for a walk expecting some reward along the way, I
am treating the walk as a means to the end which is the reward.  This
is to say that we influence our state of mind based on how we approach
a given situation.

This relates to what I have talked about regarding the concept of
self-improvement.  Do I want to be a better version of myself because,
say, it invigorates me?  Or do I want it to improve my chances at
whatever market?  Which takes precedence?

If we think that doing something comes with the externality of
recognition, reward, desert (as in _deserve_), we entertain the
falsehood of entitlement.  We believe that we have the right to
something.  For instance, I do all this hard work and so I deserve to
be this or that.  The reason entitlement/desert is misguided is
because it assumes that we are the epicentre of the world and that
everything or everyone is watching us and acts as the arbiter who will
deliver what we have earned the right to.  Do we know for a fact that
such a per-person justice exists that always rewards us with riches,
health, partnership, or whatnot?  We sure have faith that such a
universal and personalised justice exists, but does it?  I have my
doubts.

Entitlement and the cosmic self-centredness it implies exalts us in
our mind as special amid our peers.  We are biased in our favour by
overestimating what we do while underestimating what others have.  Why
should, say, my hard work guarantee me health instead of someone
else's natural good looks?  What's the common thread between those
two?  It doesn't matter: my point is that we want to establish
criteria where there are none.  We want to apply our instituted
reality, the sense of justice we enforce in our culture, to the cosmos
at-large.

It is this mistake that makes us feel that we are owned recognition,
success, or whatever.  We might do everything we can, yet for whatever
reason brought about by the interplay of a wide range of factors, we
do not get what we think we deserve.  If we insist on deserving the
reward we are of the disposition that our efforts are the means to
that end.  We do not get what we think is ours and we are disturbed as
a result.

As such, I am of the view that tranquility, this relaxed attitude of
not worrying about things, consists in acceptance: I do stuff because
I like them, because my natural inclinations favour them, and
acknowledge that in a world of coincidences there is no grand design
that is specific to me and, by extension, to each of us (cosmic
self-centredness on a personalised basis).

We let go of the need for recognition when we overcome the desire to
prove ourselves to others.  We conduct ourselves in accordance with
our nature (in moderation) without expecting anything from "the gods"
in return for us just being ourselves.  If there is something, so be
it.  If there isn't, so be it.

It is true that you do not control what happens to you.  For instance,
you do not control the fact that you are ageing.  What you do
influence though is your disposition: how you feel about the fact.  If
you think that your youth is "yours" exclusively and only you can
decide what happens to it, then you are wrong: it is not yours and
your opinion of what should happen to it is irrelevant.  In other
words, you will age whether you like it or not.  Extend this to
everything we do not really own.  By accepting this state of
non-ownership we again behave in a manner that is consistent with the
actuality of our experience.  We do not project our wishes and notions
of instituted reality on the world: we take it for what it is.

The "how to" is where we start thinking about the appropriate method.
In my experience, the best approach is to take it slow and focus on
the here-and-now.  We need patience.  Focusing on the present means
that we do not get distracted by the bigger goal of being aloof from
the fray of our experience: our attention is on how to perform the
next minute change that will nudge us in that direction.  For example,
I want to do this walk without thinking that I deserve a reward out of
it.  Then I want to do it again and again.  Step by step, gradually
generalising my practice, I want to make it my default attitude for
everything.

There is this misunderstanding that focusing on the here-and-now makes
us opportunistic.  No, it does not because we still operate in
accordance with knowledge and wisdom.  We do not merely react to
whatever phenomenon occurs in the given moment and lose our attention
along the way.  No, we rather adopt a method that frames the ultimate
end as a stepwise endeavour.  Equipped with this incrementalism, we
can pay attention to the moment while maintaining our undivided
attention on what we want.

As for the past, I think we can draw lessons from it.  What we must
avoid though is to think that we can reenact it.  Here too acceptance
must underpin our attitude.  We should not let our thoughts anchor us
in that which cannot be actualised, as we will then be operating
contrary to acceptance: instead of recognising how things stand, we
will fabricate our own narrative based on our biases and
rationalisations.  We will be turning our perception of a comfort zone
into a cage that confines us to the known and the accordingly desired.

In conclusion, acceptance is about taking it easy.  We do not have to
prove anything to anyone.  We do not enjoy some special status among
others and do not deserve anything from some bespoke cosmic justice
that monitors our every step individually and severally.  In this
regard, we have a lot to learn from, say, the dog that simply does
what its condition renders possible.  If we let go of our expectations
of how the cosmos should be, if we forgo this entitlement of ours, we
too will be dog-like in our disposition.  There will be a lightness to
our being and we will take whatever comes our way as part of this
singular reality of the world: life, death, happiness, grief, and all
others are part of the larger whole we belong to.
