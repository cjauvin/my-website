The following is an excerpt of a private exchange.  I am sharing it with

information.

Sounds good.  Have you received any feedback from your colleagues about
it?  Do they appreciate it, find it helpful, etc.?

As we noted before, the key is not to take everything at face value and,
generally, to be eclectic.  We want to learn from myths (and tradition
overall) but also view them with a critical eye or an open mind: to keep
what we consider pertinent and dismiss the rest.

There is an ancient Greek saying: "a healthy mind in a healthy body".
It basically remarks on the interdependence between the two.  As I
explain in my writings, I don't think the mind and the body are distinct
magnitudes: they are part of the same system (interconnectedness is also
why I have written that I consider it misguided to think that we
can/must be purely rational/emotional/mystical or whatever---as humans
we are a bit of everything that our nature renders possible or
necessary).

The way you phrase this tells me that you have already given it a
negative value.  I do not know the specifics, so maybe your assessment
is correct.  What follows is a general commentary on defeatism.  Sorry
if I am running off on a tangent.

Defeatism typically takes the form of extreme pessimism.  Though in my
experience it can be either of two other main feelings: (i) a
misrepresentation of one's abilities, (ii) a misunderstood pragmatism.

Consider an example of extreme pessimism: there is a pandemic going on
and you---the general "you", not you in particular---fear that it will
last forever to the point where you no longer try to adapt to the
prevailing conditions and live those moments.  While a degree of fear or
caution is justifiable, it is wrong to claim that things will remain as
they are indefinitely---that cannot be known with certainty.  In this
sense, defeatism is a type of dogmatism, where you do not really know
the probabilities or the most likely outcomes, yet insist on the
specific view that you have as if it is the absolute truth.

Then we have defeatism as a misrepresentation of one's own abilities.
We often are our own worst enemies.  We don't believe in our strengths.
And here I may add that introverts like me are more prone to that bias,
as we are introspective (almost to a fault) and can thus be misled into
thinking that everyone sees what we do in our mental mirror---they
don't.  At any rate, here is an example of not having faith in
ourselves: you go walking in nature and as you stand at the foot of a
hill you get the impression that it is impossible to climb to its top,
even though you have been walking for long enough to know deep inside
that the task should not be impossible.  If you internalise that
impression, if you tell yourself "I can't make the climb, therefore I
won't", you create a self-fulfilling prophecy where you do not try and
thus do not get what you could have gotten.  The self-fulfilling
prophecy becomes a vicious cycle that feeds into the defeatist mood: you
don't try, you don't get results, you rationalise those as proof that
you are not good enough, so you don't try, don't get results, and so on.
In other words, defeatism of this sort may be more of a mental block.
The specifics will determine how best to circumvent it.  It may require
an incrementalist approach of taking measures to ease your way into
facing the challenge or it might be much easier than you think (i.e. you
are overthinking it).  To continue with the example, the incrementalist
solution is to try longer walks for some days/weeks until you have the
stamina to walk up the hill, while the case of overthinking, of making a
mountain out of a hillock, is addressed by simply trying and finding for
yourself how you measure up to the task.  If you still fail, that should
not be interpreted as failure, but as a sign that an incremental
approach is needed and that you have to try again at a later point.

Lastly, there is defeatism as misunderstood pragmatism.  We rationally
assess a state of affairs and conclude that the outcome will not be the
desirable one.  However, we are faced with pressure not to admit our
findings and instead explain them as extreme pessimism.  For example, if
you have a dog with a high prey drive you know that there is no amount
of training that can be done to take the predator out of the canine.
The dog will always chase after whatever it sees as pray (rodents, cats,
birds, ...).  To admit the fact that you cannot train the dog not to be
predatory is not defeatism.  You have not given up.  You have not made
an estimate about the future based on random emotions or biased
impressions.  You simply recognise the truth.  So instead of apologising
to your neighbour that your training is not good enough (the defeatism),
you explain what the nature of things is, that a dog is a domesticated
predator, and that it must be treated with the requisite
respect/responsibility as well as firmness and kindness, instead of
being seen as a toy or accessory.  Put simply, do not yield to social
pressure to explain your pragmatism as you being wrong in your
assessment.  Maybe those who pressure you need to change their views.

The above are analytical constructs.  In practice we can have
combinations of them or permutations between them, depending on the
specifics of the case.  Whatever the particularities, we often find
ourselves in difficult situations.  Because we do not really know the
magnitude of the challenge and/or the maximum potential of our abilities
we think that the odds are against us.  In those moments, it is easy to
conclude that we suffer from some frailty of character or a defect of
sorts.  It will help if we can take a deep breath, drink some water, and
think things through.  The solution may be simpler than we think: the
hillock is not a mountain, the cat is not a tiger.  Even when we cannot
do something, that is not a reason to beat ourselves for it.  Every
person is different and comes with their own talents and inclinations.
We must learn to live with what we have.

[ Again, this is not a comment on your statement as I do not have
  information about the specifics of your situation.  Just a general
  remark. ]

I don't think Socrates elaborated on that matter.  At least not in
explicit terms.  Implicitly though, he (and others) have a lot to teach
us.  Socrates lived as a philosopher, meaning that his life was
committed to the approximation of the truth.  As a scientist, you
understand what that means and, I believe, you can apply what you
already know to other aspects of your life, including your own thoughts.

Consider, for example, what I mentioned above about dogmatism,
misunderstood pragmatism, internalising/rationalising false beliefs, and
the like.  How do we overcome those?  Do we simply stop thinking about
them and they go away?  No.  We must face up to them in order to
understand their extent.  We have to conduct research, if you will.  We
learn to overcome them by studying how things stand, by examining the
constitution of the case: what the factors are, what is the interplay
between them, what states of affairs they engender, and so on.  That
happens by committing to the approximation of the truth: maintain an
attitude of non-commitment to ideas, projects, desires, etc., by
remaining dubitative and inquisitive.

By "non-commitment" I basically mean that you do not assign a definitive
value to things because that would be an implicit claim of firm
certainty.  Arbitrary certitude will eventually be exposed, so if you
are deeply invested in it you will be left shocked.

Put differently, what Socrates teaches us modern people (not just
Socrates, but since you mentioned the name...) is that we must be
consistent and put to practice what we know.  Take your role as a
scientist for example: you should not be a scientist only when you enter
the lab.

I think this is the right conclusion: you simply cannot prove that you
are not good enough based on the available information.  However, I
would add that even if you don't get positive answers that still does
not amount to conclusive evidence.  As you stated, each university has
its own criteria and particular requirements, so it may all come down to
a matter of which person's skillset better matches the skills requested.
Supply and demand, if you will.

On another note, I know how it is to be emotionally invested in
something you enjoy doing.  You already told me about your passion for
science and I know exactly how that feels.  It is normal to really care
about it and to want the best for it.  In my experience, this emotional
investment comes with the potential of major disappointment.  Sometimes
things are not meant to be for a wide variety of reasons beyond our
control.  Just like the fact that there may be a mismatch between your
skills and those demanded by the university.  What matters then is to
distinguish between what is within your control and what lies outside of
it.  Always try your best for what you can control and simply stop
worrying about the rest: you cannot control them and worrying about them
makes no difference.

What I learnt through the hard way is that you should try not to
identify yourself with the thing you do, especially not in terms of
social validation.  Tell yourself that you do it for its inherent
subjective value, regardless of whether others appreciate what you do.
To offer an example that may seem trivial though I think is governed by
the same mechanics: nearly ten years ago I used to maintain a social
media presence where I would publish something on my website and then
share it in the hope of receiving feedback.  Oftentimes I would not get
as many "likes" as I would want, which made me think that I was doing
something wrong and that people did not approve of it.  Eventually I
realised that I was not writing for the purpose of accumulating "social
points".  I was writing because I liked it regardless of what others
thought.  So I quit social media and continued writing without sharing
my work on any platform.  That made me happier, more calm, and more
grounded in the reality of my experience: the reality that my subjective
evaluation mattered to me and other peoples' thoughts were irrelevant in
that regard.

I think the key is to decouple what you like from what that may be bring
you.  In your case this means to continue with science for its own sake
regardless of whether you get a faculty position.  I understand this
sounds a bit nihilist, as in saying that "there is no value in
anything", though I believe it is more subtle: there is value in what
you do because it is within your control and you make the valuation, but
there is no point in trying to assign value to variables that do not
change based on how you see/treat/evaluate them.  Again, there is no
point in worrying about factors outside our control (what our nature
renders possible, what others think, what kind of situation we are in,
and so on).

I did not understand those insights and only learnt them through
terrible experiences.  This essay I published recently, titled "Why you
should not worry", makes references to depression and nihilism:

[ These dialogues are based on real conversations.  They seem to be more
  approachable than an essay format or some condensed aphoristic
  notes. ]

This is a profound insight!  The example I have used in publications and
private exchanges is that of the turtle: one slow and steady step at a
time as it ventures on its destination.

It is a challenge and it will be difficult at first (it is the same with
everything we do, where we initially struggle with it until we get
better).  As with all matters, the best way to cope with mental health
is to apply the right techniques, like the decoupling I mentioned above.
In general though, health should come about organically as the end
result of a cumulative process that is characterised by harmony.  Simply
put, you just go about doing your own thing without stress or pressure
because you like it and you do not worry about what lies outside your
control: that makes you happy and keeps you calm.  Eventually you learn
to be more aloof, more detached from your hobbies or passions, more
distanced from yourself (hopefully that does not sound crazy, but if it
does I can elaborate), and are able to keep a tranquil mind.

Again though, we should remember that the body is equally important.  We
should not disregard it and try to become purely rational, spiritual,
intellectual, mystical...  If such beings exist they are not human---and
we are only human, so we must do what our nature entails.  The health of
the body matters.  If, for example, you only eat junk food that will
inevitably affect your mind as well.  So "the right techniques" extend
to basic knowledge like eating natural foods in moderation and doing
some amount of exercise (I think 30 minutes of walking per day is a good
target to have, though it can be complemented with other types of
exercise (nothing excessive though as that has adverse effects)).  It
all is about finding a balance based on your subjectivity.

Good to know!  Maybe you could ask your mentor for practical advice on
how to improve those methods?  Otherwise you can observe his techniques
more closely now that you know what to look for and learn from them.

Haha, that's okay!  Interviewers tend to be more distant and "less
human" because their role demands as much.
