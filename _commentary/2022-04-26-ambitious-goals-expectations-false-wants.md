There is no need for formalities.  What matters is to communicate your
thoughts in a clear way.  The reason I say "my name is Protesilaos, also
known as 'Prot'" is to hint at this preference of mine to focus on the
substance.

I notice that you write "too ambitious", implying that there is a
relative increase compared to whatever baseline.  We can think of it as
an exaggeration that deviates from the mean and which you already
recognise as problematic.  Let's continue with your points and I will
revisit this theme further below.

Your habits seem to be keeping you focused on what you like and help you
stay productive.  Taking breaks between studying is perfectly fine and
should actually help you return to the task with greater enthusiasm.

The time-price, or what the economist would call the "opportunity cost",
is inherent to everything we do.  Whatever is always present cannot have
a moral quality, because the valuation we make of it cannot affect the
underlying mechanics: its presence is not a function of our conception
of it.  For example, if we say that the speed of light is bad for
whatever reason, that moral view is pointless as it cannot change the
speed of light.  Morality is pertinent when it applies to magnitudes
whose use-value and context-specific function is contingent on the human
factor.  For more on this matter, read/watch my presentation on
[conventions, relativism, and cosmopolitanism](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-02-21-relativism-cosmopolitanism/)
(2022-02-21).

It follows that we cannot have regrets for the very presence of the
opportunity cost.  There is nothing we can do to remove it.  What we can
control are the choices we make when facing trade-offs or configuring
our preferences accordingly.  Something will always have to give.  The
key is to find the right balance.

Wanting to be excellent at something can be both a virtue and a vice.
The distinction between the two rests on the correspondence between
ambition and ability.  If you are indeed competent, then excellence is a
lofty goal that motivates you to insist on what you are doing and
become better at it.  Otherwise it is a pernicious delusion, a fleeting
dream whose continued pursuit will only harm you as it will always keep
contradicting your underlying condition.

I am not aware of the evidence you allude to.  My approach to every
scientific finding is to consider the methodology.  Did they focus on
students who only followed the curriculum and did not study anything
else outside the classroom?  How do they even create the appropriate
laboratory conditions for this to be reliable?  How can a student
isolate the stimuli between the class and everything they learn outside
of it, such as through their hobbies, and report accurate data?  And how
can the researcher draw those fine delineations with precision?  Are
there differences in character, cultural background, self-selection that
are accounted for and is the weight assigned to each of them correct?
While I do not know what this evidence is and am not an expert on the
subject matter, I must voice my scepticism given the available
information.

The truth is that no college will do the work for you.  The professor
will ask you to read from a textbook and expect you to provide valid
answers during an exam or term paper.  You can fake knowledge by
parroting it, which is the norm in our current schooling system.  That
will make you a "good student" per your high grades.  Though you will
not learn how to think critically about evolving circumstances that
bring about states of affairs which the textbook either did not consider
at all or mentioned in passing.

What I am hinting at here is that your pursuit of excellence is neither
limited to nor exhausted in the college you pick.  If you are a prodigy,
as you wrote, then you will be able to learn without acting like a
parrot and then you will be in a position to provide new insights and
think for yourself.  For as long as the college is not actively
inhibiting you, it is irrelevant in this regard.

Which brings me to two conceptions of "excellence": the formal or
nominal and the substantive.  Formal excellence is all about social
status, else prestige.  You go to a fancy university typically because
your family is well-off (the exception of a genius notwithstanding) or
were lucky to be born in a given culture/milieu, and are automatically
considered a cut above the rest.  Some of the last few Greek prime
ministers all graduated from Harvard.  On paper, this makes them _ipso
facto_ excellent.  In practice, they are the scions of dynasties who
have all the requisite connections and clout to create the appearance of
sophistication.  I do not consider any of those prime ministers to be
excellent, let alone geniuses.

Substantive excellence must then be one which is devoid of pretences to
intellectuality.  It is about leading something to perfection and doing
it in earnest.  Insofar as you are concerned, this means that you will
have to conduct yourself with the necessary rigour to reach the heights
you aspire to in computer science and mathematics.  A good college might
help you get started or, perhaps, take a shortcut but do not make the
mistake of thinking that a prestigious college will spoon-feed you
excellence and you will simply be great by association.  You have to
earn it.

The focus should be on what you do, not whether the institution is "for
non-ambitious people".  Here I am assuming that the college is not
fraudulent in that it has been certified by the state to provide its
services.  As such, it cannot be outright inappropriate.  If so, then I
wonder if it truly inhibits your ambition or this is some
rationalisation you have come up with to conceal your sub-par
performance compared to the excellence you proclaim.  For as long as the
college provides you with a setting where you can study in peace, I find
it unlikely that it is holding you back.

This situation calls for sincerity.  Is your ambition aligned with your
actuality.  Is it a virtue or a vice, as I mentioned earlier?  Are you
really a prodigy?  And what does it even mean to be a prodigy?  Is it
about high grades in a formal education setting?  Or is it about
ingenuity which, for whatever reason, might not be expressed in the
framework of higher education?  It is entirely possible to be brilliant
but also a bad student.  Though you are the one who knows the truth
here.  Are you being honest with yourself?  Have you made the right
assessment of your ability?  Or are you engaged in a tacit role-playing
game where you try to conform with the persona of the prodigy and must
now force yourself to live up to expectations held by your
family/friends/peers even though your "inner voice" says you should be
doing something else instead?  If you are role-playing, that might
explain why you think of the college as geared towards people who lack
ambition: it is your way out of the persona that your entire being
rejects; it is your way of stressing the contradiction between what your
disposition is and what your "social you"---the avatar of those
expectations---tries to do.

I cannot tell what the answers are, as I do not know you.  What I do
know is that every smart kid is called a prodigy and is placed under
immense pressure to be great, where "greatness" typically implies
earning a decent income and having the concomitant social standing.
This is not the best environment for talents to flourish.  It forces a
tokenistic mindset on how we treat people as a function of their job and
social status.  It thus remains limited to the surface level.
Appearances can be deceptive, just as with those Greek prime ministers
who are neither excellent nor geniuses despite all the pretences,
degrees and certificates _cum laude_, and oodles of money to the
contrary.

If you can quit and go to a better college without disruptions, then do
it.  2-3 years is a major investment in time and you must also consider
the state of your finances.  Again though, notice the distinction I made
between formal and substantive excellence and focus on the factors you
control right now, not some imaginary future version of yourself who
necessarily operates in idealised conditions.  The "here and now" must
always come first.  We have a tendency to formulate a romanticised view
of an alternative timeline where everything just works perfectly.  The
problem with such timelines is that we forget to factor everything that
makes our actual condition more difficult than its idealised
counterparts.  In other words, it is easy to trick ourselves into
believing a sweet lie.

To me this implies that you do not really care about the role-playing
game.  Your problem is not the "college made for non-ambitious people",
as you described it, but the socially-imposed requirement of getting a
degree from a prestigious higher education institution.  You really
struggle with the fact that you cannot pursue your own desires and are
instead forced to do something you find dull and incredibly boring.

In case it is not clear from what I do, I am the sort of person who does
not care about social standing, what my family and friends think I
should be doing, whether I have a career and am successful, et cetera.
My opinion is that if something persistently feels wrong for you, then
there is a high chance it actually is incompatible with your
constitution.  You have the option to do what you want and quit the
role-playing game.

The tricky part is to earn a living.  If you are fine with doing
whatever job is available and then dedicating your time to your
passions, then go for it and assume responsibility for the consequences
of your actions.  If, however, your priority is a stable income then you
have to make sacrifices: set your hobbies to the side and focus on
whatever money-making requires, such as acquiring a degree from a
prestigious university.

The most important lesson is to be honest.  Wisdom consists in remaining
open to the truth.  There is no faking it.

I mean this in the everyday sense of not deluding yourself with false
wants and claiming things to be different than what they actually are,
but also in the sense of remaining inquisitive and dubitative: if you
are committed to the truth, you have the courage to accept that your
prior beliefs are wrong when new evidence indicates you should
reconsider your position.  The philosophically minded person is honest
by remaining open to the possibility of finding the truth.  It is not
about the answers, it is about the disposition.

Honesty is what you need right now.  You wrote in your email that you
are "too ambitious" and you also described a conflict of different sets
of desires.  You have to muster the strength to examine all the factors
that inform the specifics of this case.  You cannot have everything.
Whenever you face an inescapable trade-off you have to forgo something.
Are you truly "too ambitious" or are you really suffering from peer
pressure and would rather throw it all to the wind and do what your
being desires?

> I am sorry if i am not following proper email hygiene or ettiquete, or
> if i was not formal enough.  -- Mr. WannabeStoic

Again, no worries about etiquette.  I am as relaxed as it gets.  To me,
being pedantic in the wrong context, or trying to win a pointless
argument for the sake of declaring yourself a winner, is a sign of
foolishness.

In conclusion, I have to comment on the "WannabeStoic" part.  I still
have not studied the stoics, though I get the impression that Zenon of
Citium (and every other philosopher for that matter) would nudge you to
recognise how things stand and become "WannabeMY-TRUE-SELF".  What your
"true self" is remains elusive and subject to change.  No school of
thought has all the answers.  The key is your attitude.

Understand the objective magnitudes and how your subjectivity perceives
of them.  You can only ever do what your being renders possible.  Only
once you figure out what its potential is, will you emancipate yourself
from the kind of struggle you go through.  You will be free from
conflicts, such as the one you outlined herein, once you overcome the
hypocrisy.  To be clear: I am not blaming you for being a hypocrite.  We
are conditioned to pursue roles that are not consistent with our
actuality.  It is why philosophy is a way of living: you have to change
who you are in order to be a friend of wisdom.
