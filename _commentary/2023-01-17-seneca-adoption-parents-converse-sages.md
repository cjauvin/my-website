What follows is a two-part excerpt from a private exchange.  I am
sharing it with the express permission of my correspondent, without
disclosing their identity.  The quoted/indented text is the one I am
commenting on.

This is very interesting and I will comment at length.  Can I publish
this on my website together with your text right above?  I will not
disclose your contact details.  I want to share it because others may
find it interesting as well.  What do you think?

I have not read any of Seneca's works and am generally not familiar
with the Stoic corpus of work: I am relying on this quote you are
providing me with.  I am missing the context and there is a good
chance I will not make a fair counter-point to Seneca's claim despite
my best intentions.  Please keep this in mind.

The notion that we can change our parents makes us think about how
much control we exert over our life.  If we can make a decision that
undoes that which our birth determines, then maybe we are the
architects of our condition.  While I agree that we have power over
our disposition, meaning how we relate to phenomena and conduct
ourselves accordingly, I think that our impact on the parametric
aspects is negligible or none at all.

Consider that parenthood is not a momentary event that belongs to some
distant and irrelevant past.  In this case, that which has transpired
ramifies to the present and continues to affect it.  It is, in this
regard, "ever-present".

Our genes condition our trajectory before we even get started and
remain with us till death.  Our physical traits as well as our mental
attributes are passed down to us.  Intelligence, strength, height,
talents, proneness to all sorts of conditions and much more are part
of our biological constitution.  We do not get to opine on them,
whether they will be a part of us or not.  We can neither own nor
disown them in the sense that we do not exert power over them.  As
such, we cannot refashion ourselves completely, such as for someone
with the creative genius of Salvador Dalí to turn into an engineering
genius of the likes of Linus Torvalds or, more commonly, for a
sociopath to turn into a highly sensitive sweetheart.

Biology is not the sole determinant though.  Our environment, and the
stimuli we are subject to, amplify, suppress, or render actualisable
that which is latent in us.  This adds another dimension to parents
and parenthood.  It is our parents who decide our place of birth on
our behalf as well as the milieu we grow up in.  By extension, they
set us on a cultural trajectory that will have a profound effect on
our outlook, whether positive or negative.

By the time we have the maturity to make the kind of decision that
Seneca describes, we have already been moulded by the natural and
cultural environment we are immersed in.  Since I already mentioned
the former, consider some examples of the latter.  We went to school
or not, enrolled for dance classes or not, started learning music or
not, spent all day outdoors playing football or not, studied for hours
on end to become doctors or not, had many friends or not, went to
parties or not, and so on.  The influences from all those sources are
considerable.  We cannot draw an indelible line between "nature" and
"nurture" as we do not have the means to test each set of hypotheses
_in vitro_.  Our life unfolds _in vivo_ as an interplay between all
those ever-evolving factors.

I feel that in this quote Seneca downplays how much we are the product
of magnitudes that are not subject to our volition.  Furthermore, he
assumes that we always have the luxury of choice and will not face
repercussions.  Does, for example, a slave in the earlier days of the
USA have the freedom to choose their parents?  Does a woman in today's
Iran have it when they cannot even attend a football stadium?  What
about the 18-year-old Russian boy---yes, "boy"---who is
unceremoniously sacrificed to the altars of imperialism?

It is easy to discount politics and draw a hagiographic representation
of the individual in which only the person matters and the backdrop
lacks any sort of detail.  The fact, however, is that there is an
instituted reality that envelops us and extends outside our reach.
Just as our genetic makeup writes the ruleset that influences us
biologically, our culture enforces the set of values that inform,
frame, condition, or otherwise determine our thoughts and attitudes.
Yes, we do have individuality and a kernel of will that manifests as
purposeful action, though the parameters of our life are neither of
our doing nor "ours".

We thus have genetic and epigenetic forces at play.  Both of those
magnitudes are, in simple terms, of our parents' making (or even of
generations prior to them, but the point is the same).

My opinion is that Seneca is mistaken in exaggerating the control we
have.  Again though, I am missing the context and am not making a
holistic critique of his work or the Stoic enterprise at-large.  I am
just commenting on a snippet of text and may be wrong.

This is a good point and I agree with it.  We are doing it now, as we
too are in the company of Seneca's thoughts and benefit from those
snippets of wisdom.

Tangentially, this is why I value the dissemination of knowledge: we
provide a gift to all possible people and we do it for its inherent
worth, not our personal gain.  Once we realise that "our" thoughts are
not ours to take somewhere else, once we escape from the narrow
confines of our ego and understand the bigger picture, we develop an
attitude of sharing.

I call this the "Promethean ideal" but I will not bother you now with
a long exposition.

This is true, though it also goes the other way: the dead will not be
there for us either.  Few people will be there for us, though "few" is
better than none.  Humans are flawed and we cannot be friends with
everyone---that's okay.  The people we encounter are fully fledged and
so we get to see all their facets, whereas we have limited knowledge
of an ancient figure.  For example, what kind of person was Zeno?
(Zeno is a popular name in the Greek-speaking parts of Cyprus, by the
way---a derivative of an inclination of "Zeus" (Ο Ζευς, Του Ζηνός)).
Was Zeno funny?  Could one rely on him for emotional support?  Was he
an introvert?  Did he enjoy the city life of Athens or was he there by
necessity?  I have so many questions about the actual person!

My point is that we have a prettified image of ancient sages.  We only
get to see the parts that make them great and we then add the details
using our imagination.  In filling in those blanks, we run the risk of
projecting our biases onto them or, else, of justifying our views on
the basis of their authority.

A dead philosopher cannot converse with us.  We do not have the luxury
we are enjoying right now where we can continue exploring a given
topic in order to understand it better.  If I misunderstand Seneca,
there is a good chance that I will live with that misunderstanding
forever: I cannot contact the author to ask anything.  Whereas if I
misunderstand you in whatever it is we are discussing, I can send you
another message asking the relevant questions.  In theory, I can have
a video chat with you and even meet you in person.  I consider this a
"luxury" we have, as it helps us minimise errors brought about by
misunderstandings.  We can be less biased in this way.

While we want to be in the company of past greats, we still need
actual people around us who can enrich our life.  Those people will be
flawed as we will get their unfiltered version.  So "enrich" is not
just a matter of engaging in philosophical inquiry but also of
partaking in all those other activities that make us human.  These
other experiences still have value to the philosopher, for they
provide insight into aspects of our reality.  As philosophers, we have
the disposition of seeking and approximating the truth: we are not
arbitrarily limiting ourselves to books or specific sources.  At least
this is how I see it: live fully.

Yes, this is a valuable insight.  We have plenty of time, but we must
use it properly.  Someone who is not considerate will reach 30, 60, 90
years of age and feel they did nothing.  In a sense, the mindful life
is eternal because each experience is lived purposefully in the
here-and-now.

The ancient Greeks had a notion of posthumous fame (υστεροφημία,
hystefemia).  It is tempting to interpret this as vanity writ large,
though I think it is a call for each person to aspire to their
highest.  Basically, the idea is to do something that future
generations will find valuable.  Do something for the greater good and
others will benefit from it.  Even if they do not "remember" you by
name or by attributing the work to you, the impact of your work is
nonetheless retained.  You do not care about your posthumous fame,
anyway, as you are already dead.
