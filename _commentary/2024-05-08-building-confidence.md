The following is an excerpt from a private exchange. I am sharing it
with the permission of my correspondent. Their identity remains
private.

There is no easy way to feel more confident. It is an attitude we
build over time. In my experience, the best way to gradually gain
confidence is to aim for "small wins". Try to do simple things: do
them well; do them consistently. Master the everyday basics, like
washing your face first thing in the morning, keeping your desk tidy,
preparing your own meal, and the like.

The idea is to set yourself up to be more reliable and dependable in
what you do. If everything around you is in a disorderly state, you feel
you have no control over what is happening, so you naturally do not
believe you have the power to affect anything. This sense of
powerlessness is fuel for your insecurity.

When you do those basic things, you have to put your heart into them. Do
not fake it. These are not "chores" anymore. They are rituals that will
remake you. You have to do them in earnest. This way, you will know deep
inside that you did not cheat and you earned something rightfully.

The tricky part with confidence is that we are our own self's worst
enemy. Before convincing others that we are worthy, we have to prove
this to the mirror. This is why the "small wins" are the best place to
start: the stakes are low and we act in the safety of our immediate
environment.

Show to yourself that you can get things done. Keep going without
interruptions. Spend the time it takes to improve yours skills. Again,
these are not chores. If you are not committed and do not do what you
must consistently, you will lose your momentum and revert to feeling
inadequate.

Take it one step at a time and do not overcommit. Become good at
something small and gradually expand from there.

Once you do the basics right, try to extend the same principles to
more demanding tasks. For example, when you are studying for school,
do not just memorise what you were taught in class. Instead, read more
on your own to actually understand what the subject matter is. This
way, you will prove to yourself that you have acquired the relevant
knowledge. That inner voice which whispers the doubts will then be
forced to shut up, otherwise it will be talking nonsense---and you
will be sure it is nonsense.

I will return to the point of feeling ashamed a bit later, but let me
first comment on your other remarks.

Remember the basics I mentioned above. They are hard to do
consistently, right? If you spot someone who does those flawlessly,
will you not admire them for it? You might not express admiration, but
you will probably feel it. The same is true for sport. When you see
Lionel Messi glide through the field with that peerless close control
of the football, do you not get a sense of awe at the sheer potential
of the man himself and of humanity at-large? When Cristiano Ronaldo
towers over everyone to score a header, do you not acknowledge
greatness?

With sport, you know that there is only one way to get better: train
harder. There is no faking it. Again, this is about working on the
basics. Do more running to build up your stamina. Work on your
explosiveness and core body strength. Practice with the ball, to pass it
with the right weight and shoot it with greater accuracy. Once you put
in the work, you will know that at least in terms of work ethic and
attitude you have earned respect. Then, if someone still beats you, you
simply admit they are more talented and/or physically gifted than you.
But you are worthy of respect regardless.

Do not worry about this elitism you mention. It will be fixed on its
own once you get in the flow of earning small wins. You will better
appreciate how difficult things actually are and will begin to value
the finer points. This is a subtle quality in a person, which you only
recognise if you yourself have gone through the rigours. Whereas now
your attitude is more along the lines of "all or nothing", which
usually means you get nothing. This is fine. Do not worry about it and
stick to the basics.

It is a vicious cycle, indeed. It will lose its force naturally as you
work on your routines. Always keep in mind that we build up confidence.
It does not just come out of nowhere.

About questioning yourself, this is not a problem per se. Some
self-doubt keeps us in check and inspires us to try our best. While
the small wins give us ample evidence which we can use to silence this
inner critic. It is a balance. If you do not do the work properly,
then the inner voice is left unchecked to make harsh comments that
sound convincing.

Now to the topic of shame. It is inhibiting you and feels terrible,
though think why you are ashamed of failing to meet some standard: it
is because you have a standard to begin with. The way to deal with
this is two-fold:

1. Lower the standard to something more realistic. You will know what
   that will look like after you gain more experience, so do not worry
   if you cannot find the right target at this early stage.

2. Try harder to meet that standard. It will have to be realistic, as
   noted above, though still require some effort from your side.

How realistic a standard is has to do with your perception of yourself
versus others. You are likely underappreciating your abilities and
overappreciating the abilities of others. Everybody has doubts and all
must put in the work to achieve what they want. It just happens that you
are perhaps more aware of yourself than others are of theirs. This has
the downsides you are experiencing, though it can be turned into a
strength of yours, as you can become more thoughtful, considerate, and
nuanced.

Whatever you do, take it easy. The world does not depend on your
performance. Not everybody is focused on your every move and thought:
they have their own issues to deal with. Once you get in the flow of
small wins, you will gradually start enjoying a challenge and will
thrive in it. But this is for the future. Your goal now is to start
small, proceed one step at a time, and do things right.

Good luck!
