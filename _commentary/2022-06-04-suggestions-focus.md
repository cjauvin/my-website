I received the titular question in a recent message.  There wasn't much
more to it.  Below is my reply.

* * *

There is no one-size-fits-all. I cannot provide a recipe like "eat two
meals a day" and expect it to produce the same results for everyone.
You will need to figure out the details that are best suited to the way
your organism works.  Still, there are some patterns we find in all of
us, differences in degree notwithstanding.

Let me start with how I conceptualise the human organism:

* There is no actual mind-body distinction.  When we speak of those as
  if they have a standalone presence, we are engaging with analytical
  constructs.  Analytics have their utility (obviously!), though we must
  never conflate their necessarily _in vitro_ representation with their
  corresponding _in vivo_ state.  Put differently, do not mistake the
  abstraction for its instantiations.

* The mind and the body are systems of systems that form part of a
  greater system.  This is the human organism, which itself is part of a
  greater system of systems, and so on.  For our purposes, the mind and
  the body co-exist, are inter-dependent, and have a circular
  relationship where one influences the other.  You cannot have one
  without the other.

* You do not need me to tell you this---you know it from a young age.
  When you are ill, or tired, or feeling cold, etc., you cannot operate
  at the peak of your mental powers.  Conversely, when you are led
  astray by delusions, stressed by unattainable false wants, pressured
  by inane social expectations, and the like, your body's condition
  starts to deteriorate as you lose motivation, may have trouble with
  your sleep cycle, might develop depression...

If you find it difficult to focus and believe that the answer is to
"think harder", as it were, you are doing it wrong.  Your method is
incorrect: it will always yield undesirable results no matter the effort
you put into it.  What you need is a different/better method.  Take a
step back to assess your overall condition.  Do you eat healthy?  Do you
do any kind of physical work?  Are there times in your day during which
you are not constantly stimulated (e.g. time off the computer, no music,
and the like)?

Review your habits and identify patterns that are detrimental to your
health.  The rule of thumb is that if something is done too much, it is
bad for you.  I call this a "rule of thumb" because there are some cases
that are deleterious at the outset.  For instance, junk food undermines
your overall condition no matter what.  There is no virtuous balance
where "some junk" is okay.  I believe you can figure out those clear-cut
cases.  In general though, your goal must be to strike the right balance
between not having something in your life to having too much of it.
Take sport as a case in point: do not exercise 10 hours a day---it is
too much, as it drains your energy and thus prevents you from pursuing
other fulfilling experiences, such as observing a sunset, reading poetry
out loud, or thinking through the mechanics of a theory.

Consider everything you like.  Now be honest with yourself: are you in
control of it, or does it control you?  Don't just blithely say it and
move on: put it to the test!  You want to answer the question of whether
you can live without it for a little while, such as through a few hours
of abstention per day.  Let's say you are a hobbyist programmer and
enjoy coding 8 hours a day for leisure.  Can you reduce it to 5 hours
with long break in-between?  Use the remainder of your free time to go
for a swim, take a walk in the park, hike, or, generally, do something
unrelated to programming.

The purpose of such tests is to teach you to practice restraint and push
back a bit against your comforts.  You want to be in control and not act
impulsively or complacently.

Part of this introspection involves the identification of obsessions or
addictions.  Do you have a smartphone?  Chances are you are addicted to
it.  What is your first reaction as soon as you stay alone for a couple
of minutes and are away from the computer?  Pull out the phone?  Yes,
that is a clear sign of compulsive behaviour.  You waste time on social
media and are constantly bombarded by invidious algorithms that
prioritise instant gratification: it is what leads to addiction and
drives up "engagement".  Corporations, in their wicked pursuit for
profit maximisation at all costs, are commodifying your attention span.
There is an economic---and thus political---dimension to this, but now I
want to focus on the subjective sphere.

Cut back on all those addictions: social media, video streaming,
gaming...  Watching some videos is okay.  Playing the occasional game is
fine.  (Ever wondered about the model of free-to-play games and the
notion of "grinding"?  Connect these to the commodification I alluded to
earlier.).  The point is to take back control and pursue those
activities in a balanced way.  You get the idea.

Another major source of instant gratification is food, especially
extreme flavours like saltiness and sweetness.  Practically all
processed or packaged food contains either or both of those tastes.
Here, I do not limit sweetness to sugar, but broaden it to all sorts of
sweeteners and preservatives (e.g. corn syrup or more exotic
ingredients).  Avoid such items.  In practical terms, quit consuming:

* soft drinks;
* juices (which are practically soft drinks, given the additives);
* energy drinks (a healthy lifestyle does not need artificial pampers
  for energy);
* alcoholic beverages (be it on their own or mixed with any of the
  above, as in long drinks and cocktails);
* chips/crisps;
* all types of bread, with the exception of the sourdough loaf (which
  you should be making at home);
* chocolates, cookies, pastries, ice cream, and all other sweets;
* salted or otherwise coated dry nuts;
* anything that comes in high concentration of one dominant flavour like
  peanut butter or honey (even the purest honey is hard to consume in
  moderation---it is too intense for you to resist it);
* fresh juices and smoothies (more on this below);
* chicken nuggets;
* fish sticks;
* burgers;
* frozen pizzas;
* all types of sauce;
* anything that thickens or adds flavour to the dish like corn starch.

The list goes on.  Basically, prefer food that has as few alterations as
possible relative to its natural state.  Same for cooking recipes: the
simpler and less fancy tends to be superior because it has fewer steps
of processing (though you will not win any social points by going full
spartan, but what good is status if it comes at the cost of your
wellness?).  For instance, raw vegetables that do not need cooking
should not be cooked: that is an extra process that is not necessary.
Everything else can be boiled in water and it will be perfect:
e.g. legumes.

The reason you want the closest-to-natural types of food is because they
are nutritious but also have the most subtle flavours---they are not
addictive (compare the number of people you know who are addicted to
eating raw carrots as opposed to chocolates, soft drinks, etc.---you get
what I am saying).  Even a sweet fruit is nothing compared to the oodles
of sugar (and not only) that we find in the average sweet.

Let me stress the point I made above about fresh juices and smoothies.
They are not bad per se.  They just provide us with a perfect example of
how something apparently good can easily be twisted and turned into its
opposite.  How many oranges would you eat on a regular sitting?  One?
Two? Four at the very most?  How many glasses of orange juice can you
drink without much effort?  At least two or maybe more if you had some
physical activity right before.  The number of oranges required to make
the juice is far greater than what you would have consumed if you were
to eat them.  In other words, it is an over-concentration of fructose,
which is bad for the liver.  And it thus constitutes the kind of
avoidable exaggeration I am hinting at throughout this text.  The same
for smoothies: I once saw someone consume an entire celery by
"smoothing" it.  There is no way you eat all that as a regular meal, yet
you casually consume it in that format.  To recap: fresh juice and
smoothies are fine, but are abusable.  Prefer eating the
fruits/vegetables as that approach generally is easier to control.

Food is a pleasure, yet you should try to reach a point where you enjoy
it while not thinking too much about it.  It is a necessity to refuel
you, but should otherwise not be calling for your attention all the
time.  You see the parallel with other forms of instant gratification:
we want to blot them out and reverse the relationship we have with them
in order to be in control.

You might be thinking that I am asking you to put yourself in a
straitjacket and spend the rest of your life in the agony of perpetual
boredom.  Relax!  If you already are in an extreme situation, the
midpoint seems like the end of the world.  To use a food analogy, if you
are used to a handful of salt for seasoning, a pinch will feel like
there is no salt at all.  It takes time to adapt to a more balanced
lifestyle.  Take it one step at a time, with patience and perseverance.

Recall what I mentioned further above: you already know about this
interconnectedness of the organism.  (When you are ill, you cannot think
properly...  And the like.)  Inconsiderate food is like a mild poison
that gradually weakens you---an illness you cannot perceive.  Bad habits
intoxicate you in a similar way by engendering through underlying
chemical processes the illusion of short-term reward which makes you
constantly yearn for more.

Once you are at that stage where you have minimised your exposure to the
vicissitudes of "the passions"---food calling for your attention, social
media distracting you, poor habits taking up your time, and so on---you
will be able to conduct yourself mindfully.  Everything will feel more
real, as your senses will no longer be overstimulated by excesses: they
will become attuned to subtleties.  You will develop a refined
perception of phenomena.  Little things that once eluded you will be
rendered conspicuous.  You will realise what we truly mean by "undivided
attention" when you can perform tasks you are good at with a degree of
focus and mastery that was not possible before.

To return to your question.  What I covered here is not the definitive
guide you may be looking for.  These are just some ideas.  The gist is
that you will have to take the long road that leads to your remaking.
There are no shortcuts.  Those who peddle quick solutions and promise
you "this one secret trick" that lets you magically escape from your
woes are appealing to the part of yourself that favours inertia.
Inertia will keep you where you are, which is the opposite of what you
need.
