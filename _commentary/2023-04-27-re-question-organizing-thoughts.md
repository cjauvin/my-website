Note that there is a possibility you are too hard on yourself.  Is it
really "word salad" or something that is "okay" while it has room for
improvement?  For example, if I ask you to write to me how you use
org-mode for what you mention here, can you provide an answer that is
one, two, or three paragraphs long?  Can that answer be "okay"?  I am
just asking for something that is not gibberish.  I think you can
achieve that given that you already did it with this email, which has a
clear intent and communicates it effectively.

I mention "okay" because sometimes the problem is that we operate with
an all-or-nothing mindset, where we want stuff to be perfect and discard
everything else.  We mistake this for ambition, though I think it is
closer to insecurity: we use perfectionism as a cover for some deep
seated concern we have.  We are afraid to make mistakes and end up in a
situation where we refrain from acting, from committing to the cause,
preferring instead to imagine how we will deal with the potential
scenaria.  This, in turn, looks like longer-term strategising, though I
think it still is a rationalisation of insecurity that actually
reinforces our fears, since it embeds them as standard behaviour.

The all-or-nothing approach engenders feelings of worthlessness, as we
end up with the "nothing" part of the deal.  We develop nihilism
vis-Ã -vis our own works, discounting their utility and dismissing their
value.  The "nothing" also reminds us how far we are from our ideal
standard, invigorating the cycle of negativity.

What I have learnt the hard way is to not be afraid to be imperfect and
to make mistakes.  Think of the baby that tries to run and falls because
it still doesn't know how to do it properly.  The baby has to learn this
way.  Sure, the fall is painful yet it offers a valuable lesson for
life.  Intellectual affairs are similar.  We err, we feel bad about it
for a while, but we retry until we eventually improve ourselves.

The goals we set must be consistent with our actuality.  The baby must
learn to walk and then run.  The teenager can then set a more ambitious
target of becoming a sprinter.  The young adult can raise the bar and
aim for the level of an Olympic athlete.  At each stage, there is a
different horizon of possibilities that depends on prior work, i.e. lots
of trials and errors.

You mention your young age and inexperience.  This is encouraging.  It
shows that you are not expecting too much too quickly.  Practice
frequently and take setbacks gracefully.  No-one starts out as the
finished article.

Yes, sticking to realisable objectives will yield results.  The key word
is "realisable".  You must have a sense of who you are and which targets
can be met with your current means.  The baby cannot be an Olympic
sprinter.  By the same token, inexperienced "you" cannot express
thoughts with the lucidity of a more experienced thinker.  Through
continuous practice, you will get better.  How good?  It does not matter
and is not the right question because it prevents you from the
here-and-now of acting.  Regardless of where your ultimate skill ceiling
is, you will not reach it if you are not prepared to admit to your
frailties.  Make mistakes and learn from them.

Sticking to simpler topics is a helpful method.  You need to be
comfortable with the basics before expanding any skill set.  Don't worry
about developing thoughts too much.  State your opinion with honesty: it
is a true representation of what you can achieve right now.  What
matters is that you do not stick with it.  Do not have a false sense of
duty towards your prior thoughts.  Allow yourself the chance to change
your mind.  This is another way of admitting to your mistakes, taking
them as a valuable lesson, and making progress from there.

Which brings me to the part about following a train of thought.  If the
train is too long, you will face difficulties at this early stage.  Keep
it to short loops.  Instead of "how to organise thoughts" shift your
attention to formulating simple ideas, however naive they may seem to
be.  Do more thinking than organising; more expressing than planning.
There is a place for organisational work, though it is not what you need
right now.  You are at the point where you want to get in the flow of
improving yourself through consistent practice.

To your final question, yes I have struggled a lot with notions of
perfectionism and the overthinking involved.  They almost broke me and I
suffered.  What I understood was that I was making things too
complicated by allowing my insecurities to inhibit my actions.  I would
remain an outsider to the act and would thus deny myself the chance to
improve through trial and error.  An outsider cannot have an intimate
understanding of the relevant themes and will not develop intuitions for
them.

When the standard is too high, you will always find yourself inadequate
and you will never do anything that fulfils you.  When you are an
outsider, you will keep thinking you are too good/bad and live with the
accompanying fantasy that is either a cheap imitation of the real
experience or an aggrandised fear.  Make mistakes and learn to
appreciate them.  Do what you like without contempt for others and try
to be the best version of yourself, one tiny bit of improvement at a
time.
