The following is an excerpt from a private exchange that I am
publishing with the permission of my correspondent. I am not sharing
their name or email.

There are two parts to this which contain my initial response and the
follow-up to it.

All the quoted/indented parts are from my correspondent.

## Part one

I will try to help. The short answer is this: you must start small.
The longer answer follows below.

There is no productivity in a vacuum and, as such, there is no method
that will work regardless of the specifics of the case. Here you are
describing various tools, methods, and requirements or wishes, but you
did not express what you are working towards. What is it you want to
achieve? Can you spell this out with clarity and certainty?

Knowing what we want is not as easy as we might think it is. Yes, we
have a general idea but elucidating it with precision is hard. Though
trying to do that helps us understand our situation better, which
practically means that we can separate the essential parts from the
inessential ones.

My first suggestion to you, then, is to establish a clear goal. This
has to be a tangible outcome of you producing something that matters
beyond the confines of the productivity suite of tools. So "make
Farley files" (I do not know what those are, by the way) is not a goal
in this regard. A goal is something like "write a research paper about
`THING`", "publish a blog post on the `THING`", "develop an Emacs
package to do `THING`", where `THING` is what you care about.

My next suggestion is to keep a sense of perspective. You are making
it too difficult for yourself right now. Remember to take a step back
and relax. Think about what is the worst thing that might happen if
you are indeed missing out on whatever the tech hipsters are using
these days. The answer is "nothing worthwhile". There are more
important things in life.

Please understand that we live in a world where hype is key to
generate clicks, views, comments, likes, and, ultimately, money.
"Hype" is a word that comes from "hyperbole", the Greek word for
"exaggeration"; the word for overdoing something. So be careful not to
fall for the hype each time you find some new app or method.

The reason I am writing this is to encourage you to be more
considerate. All that "organisation and productivity" business is more
hype than substance. It also is unimportant in the grand scheme of
your everyday experience. Try to not pay attention to the trends and
keep things simple. We have reached this point in history after
millennia of not having fancy apps. We can be productive without a lot
of pampers. This whole notion that "yOu AbSoLuTeLy NeEd ThIs ApP" is a
distraction you have to avoid.

Focus on yourself and be mindful of what you actually want (the
substance, not the hype). If you are of the mindset that digital
"productivity" is the most important thing and that you must not miss
out on the coolest trends, then you are setting yourself up for
failure. You are doing so because the stakes are now too high in your
mind: "what if I pick the wrong app?" and "what if this methodology is
not the right one?" and "how will I ever recover my productivity now
that I went down this rabbit hole?".

There are a million questions like these and they all are predicated
on the presumption that "productivity", in the form of some cool new
app and/or method, is essential. It is not, so take it easy.

Now you are prepared for my third suggestion: it is not the tool that
makes you productive, but your mindset and concomitant work ethic. You
can be perfectly productive with pen and paper or even without those,
depending on what we are talking about.

All apps, no matter how well thought out they are, are tools which do
wonders in the right hands but otherwise are clumsy implements which
inhibit those who do not know what to do with them.

Like with a sledgehammer or a pickaxe, if you do not know how to use
the tool, you will severely injure yourself. With these digital
products the damage comes in the form of anxiety and a sense of
disempowerment.

I could tell you about Emacs, and Org, and Denote, and all their best
friends, but this is not the way to go. I do not believe in the
marketing gimmick of a "second brain" and, more importantly, I dismiss
the lazy outlook of our era for doing something sophisticated in a
"too long; didn't read" kind of way. You cannot do anything noteworthy
without hard work, so either you will not read and stay where you are,
or you will put in the effort and take as much time as is necessary to
get better.

There is no magic solution. We all have one brain that does the
thinking and if we do not use it properly, no vaunted exomind will
ever be a good enough arrangement for us. Of course, if you use the
tools properly, then things change and a "second brain" starts to make
sense. But you are not there yet (and once you are there, you will
know not to be misled by such buzzwords).

My recommendation to you then is to forget about the advanced features
of logging, plotting, linking, drawing, stamping, clipping,
extracting, summarising, analysing, et cetera, and focus on the one
and only basic thing that matters: you set a goal and you do it. If
you cannot do this with consistency, then all that other stuff is just
a glorified mini-game to make you feel better about the fact you are
not actually doing what you are supposed to.

Please do not take my words personally. I am communicating to you in
plain terms to focus your attention on the fundamentals. Work on those
and master them. Once you have done that, then you can think about all
the extras. And when that happens, you will be in a position of
strength where you will (i) know what you need, (ii) are confident in
your abilities, (iii) are in the flow of doing what you are meant to,
(iv) have a clear goal that is realisable, and (v) have room for
experimentation given that you can always fall back to the basics you
are already an expert in.

If you must forgo the data you have accumulated in order to start
small, then do it ruthlessly. Do not continue to carry it around as a
burden: it will continue to weigh you down and make you suffer. Why
harm yourself in this way?

## Part two

Sounds promising! Though note that this is the stage where you have
accumulated a lot of information about those topics. Let us take Linux
as an example: unless you are already using it, set a goal to switch
to it in the near future. This involves concrete steps, such as:

- Find a distro that is good enough out-of-the-box to let you focus on
what you need (e.g. Ubuntu or Linux Mint).

- Learn how to write an `.iso` file to a flash drive.

- Learn how to boot from this `.iso` file in order to eventually
  install the Linux distro on the computer.

- Start using Linux.

This brings another point about knowledge: it cannot be purely
theoretical. You will never know Linux well enough if you do not
experience it. When we are exposed to something, we understand it
better in relation to ourselves. Through experimentation, else trial
and error, we discover more of it and us. Eventually we form opinions
backed by some personalised evidence.

All this does not require a sophisticated system of note-taking. Think
of it more like a game. You set it up to run and then you play around
with it. This is how I learnt Linux and Emacs, by the way.

I understand this kind of curiosity because I have it as well. What I
have learnt is that it is both a blessing and a curse: it drives you
to learn more things and piece them together into greater systems, but
it works counter to your reality as a human with limited
time/resources.

Concretely, you cannot let your curiosity run rampant as it will
definitely work against you: it will not let you focus on anything as
you will always be chasing off the next thing that is remotely
unfamiliar.

What I have mastered about myself is the ability to not go down rabbit
holes. I know to appreciate what I have and to only explore a case
in-depth only after I have estimated that it is part of what I can do
with my available time and energy.

You can improve this skill as well. As with everything, you have to
start small. Before doing something, ask yourself what I mentioned
earlier: "what I am trying to achieve?". If the answer is that you are
simply curious, then this is not a good sign. Be consistent with
yourself in asking this question and you will notice how the tasks
that pass the test are actually not that many.

Remember that we are considering the case of eventually starting to do
things. I am not arguing against curiosity in general. Once you are in
the flow of achieving your goals, then you will have the requisite
structure to be curious without undoing what you have.

Okay, this sounds more clear. Though it has to be couched in terms of
the aforementioned. I think a system of note-taking and knowledge
management is secondary and would thus encourage you to set it aside
for the time being.

You already know that you can collect a lot of disparate data points.
You have done this with many apps and on many topics. Finding yet
another note-taking solution will not change this dynamic. And here is
the trap people fall into. They think that there is some magical "one
app to rule them all" and so they keep searching for it. There is no
such thing though, so the vicious cycles invigorates itself.

Again, focus on the basics. Master the essentials and then you will
know what you need as the next step.

Good! Then pick one app and stick with it. It does not matter which
one it is, because it is not the app that makes you productive. Once
you have the app, start with one goal, such as "use Linux" and make it
happen. Do this with more realisable goals and make a habit of
accomplishing what you have in mind. No more rabbit holes that lead to
nowhere!

Being neat and tidy is fine. The question is practical though: where
do we start from? And my answer to this is "start small". Pick some
small thing you can actually do and do it. Let the system emerge
organically through your continuous efforts.

Right now you are an outsider to this endeavour. You are not
practising the relevant skills and are only theorising about how you
might like something. What you are missing is experience, which will
immediately ground you in the specifics of what you can and cannot do.
This goes back to my example with Linux: proceed to the next phase of
actually committing to the project and realising it.

Each person has their own way of conceptualising their immediate
milieu. There is no right or wrong here. What we all have in common
though is limited resources and an embodied mind. We cannot afford to
have a purely theoretical exposure to the world. Our reality puts us
out there and forces us to make decisions. Time is not on our side, in
the sense of mortality, but also in the sense of having only a few
hours per day to carry out our activities. We eventually get tired and
lose focus or motivation. As such, I think that all of us, despite our
individuality, need to have a sense of the here-and-now, because it is
the constant in our life.

If by "managing time" you mean to keep track of it, then this is
definitely a rabbit hole. Do not go there. Time management happens
organically: we do something we like, which necessarily means we do
not have enough resources for other activities. Every action is a
trade-off and we decide which path to take.

Instead of focusing on the structural level, such as managing time, go
back to the basics: pick something you want to do, do it, and forget
about the time dimension. As you get in this flow of working, you will
eventually establish patterns that will form a certain structure. You
will be doing certain things and not others. Once you are competent in
this regard, you will know if you actually need some time tracking app
or not (I do not, for example).

There is no formula here. It depends on the specifics of the case.
Some tasks are more involved than others and have more prerequisites.
Others are more straightforward. But if you overthink something, it
will always become complex to the point where it is virtually
impossible to do anything with it.

Check the scenario with Linux, for instance. There are only a few
steps for you to start using it on a computer. Instead of writing all
the sub-items down, start with those top-level items and work your way
from one to the other. If there are sub-tasks, you will discover them
along the way. But do not lose track of your goal: move to the next
top-level item.

As you have noticed, I am repeating myself: start with the basics,
engage with it instead of overthinking it, and remember that your time
is limited.
