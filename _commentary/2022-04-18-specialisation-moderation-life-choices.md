Yes, I think this is what we need to rediscover.  Consider the negative
connotations of the phrase "jack of all trades; master of none".  We
have a bias against polymathy and thus tend to misunderstand what
specialisation is and should be.  It is desirable to specialise, for it
is how we develop expertise in any given area of sophistication.  What
is undesirable is to believe that you can see the world through a
keyhole by thinking that knowledge of the particular is sufficient and,
indeed, fecund.

I believe I have mentioned this in passing in one of my publications:
the Olympic ethos (I will elaborate in a future publication).  You know
about the ideal of fair play in sport.  It holds an important lesson for
everyone, not just athletes.  I would argue it is essential for the
scientifically minded fellow as well.  Why, you may ask?  Because fair
play teaches us to recognise what the truth is: if ceteris paribus
someone beats you at a sport, the fact is that they performed better.
Sport (of the Olympic sort, not the unscrupulous capitalist money-making
machine) shows us that there are no true winners and losers in a game:
we all win when we elevate ourselves beyond our instinctive egoism by
playing fairly.  Then it is a matter of upbringing to cherish the
participation, not the outcome, to appreciate the substance and not be
distracted by the pursuit of ephemeral social points, medals, and
accolades.

We then see how sport and science have something in common.  Does it
matter if my theory lost to a more cogent alternative, assuming
conditions of fairness (i.e. genuine science)?  No, it does not matter
because the other theory brings us closer to the truth.  That knowledge
helps us, myself included, escape from a falsehood or an otherwise
distorted view of things.  The scientist wants to do science exactly
because of that inner need to remain inquisitive.  To be strictly
self-serving runs contrary to said inquisitiveness.

It is misguided to think of the scientific enterprise in purely
technical terms, as if it has no ethical underpinnings.  It is equally
unwise to treat sport in exclusive physical terms, art as merely
expressive, and so on for all fields of endeavour that we insist on
treating in isolation from all the rest.  Everything we do is part of a
continuum.  There is no such thing as a standalone presence.  Not in
human affairs, not in the Cosmos at-large.

Specialisation comes with the latent risk of creating incomplete human
beings.  These are the "geeks" or "nerds" when the terms are used
negatively: individuals who obsess over a narrow field of expertise,
have nothing else to think about, only make friends within that circle,
and end up living in a parallel world in which their perceptions of
selfhood and the world at-large are not challenged (this describes me at
some point in my life).  Other activities like sport and art give us a
chance to connect with people.  In the case of art, the connection can
be figurative as we may relate to the subjectivity of an imaginary hero,
the impression of an abstract figure or a soundscape, and so on.  When
we interact in earnest with different people/subjectivities and put
ourselves in unfamiliar situations, we learn more about who we really
are.  The "self" is neither fixed nor predetermined: to know who you are
is to discover the others (i.e. be open to the world).  Isn't "openness"
a prerequisite for finding the truth?

Back to the "jack of all trades".  We do not want to turn people into
charlatans who pretend to know everything: specialisation is desirable
and polymathy is not about aspiring to be an encyclopedia.  What we do
not want with specialisation is to reduce humans to machines that
perform minute tasks.  The more one knows and the more diverse that
corpus of knowledge and experiences is, the better their quality as a
person and the higher the chance they will have unique insights to
share; insights which can only be grasped by studying the intersections
and emergent realities therein.  Interdisciplinarity and, generally, the
ability to draw linkages between different views on life provides a
unique perspective on things that should not be underestimated.

My formal education was the same.  Though I was lucky that I played
football during my teenage years.  I had the memory of a time when I was
not a human-like automaton.  Once I realised that I had to become a
fully fledged human again, I decided to change how I view and do things.
Sometimes the presence of one presupposes the demise of another: I am
not who I used to be during my early twenties.

That would be the best outcome for civilisation.

I understand.  It is okay to feel disappointed.  Part of recognising the
need for a holistic world-view is to admit that we have emotions.  We do
not win anything by acting tough and by pretending that we are purely
rational (i.e. non-human).  Being too emotional is not helpful though,
as it is an extreme disposition, so it is good that you have adapted
accordingly.

To be clear: even if you were too emotional, that is still a condition
you should not be ashamed of, nor try to conceal or otherwise prettify.
The key is to recognise it for what it is and then, once you are in
control again, think critically what the root causes are.  This links
back to what I have covered before on expectations and factors beyond
our reach (my next video will be on expectations and role-playing,
though I still have not found the opportunity to record it).

Moderation is part of the picture.  It cannot be helpful if we do not
know who we are: what we actually want, what our current options are,
how the prevailing conditions influence our life, and so on.  Again,
this is about openness to the truth.

What is a moderate position for one might be an extreme reality for
another.  Every person is different.  There is no one-size-fits-all.
Hence the need to seek knowledge of your predicament and be honest about
it.

Sometimes the moderate position is not a locus between two existing
extremes: it can be a third magnitude which is not related to the other
two.  Those may be untenable and any permutation in-between might still
lead to uneasiness.  There are cases where a moderate disposition
requires a radical change, a shift in focus which provides the impetus
for a new beginning.

I cannot tell you who you are and what is happening in your life.  I
don't have answers.  I also don't know you well enough to form an
opinion.  And even if I did, I would still encourage you not to listen
to my advice.  Figure out the general idea in what I am trying to
communicate, but do the thinking yourself.  When we are searching for
answers we try to be overly thankful to someone and thus attempt to
conform with their guidelines.  Such is a false sense of duty.  My
opinion is that you should not act like a soldier who follows my
directives to the letter.

As such, I can only share general thoughts with the hope that they
inspire you to search for plausible explanations and then act
accordingly.

This is what applied to me (again, no one-size-fits-all and you should
not act without knowing who you are): there was no attainable moderation
in my "previous life".  There could be no compromise between what
appeared to be the alternatives on offer.  I did not want to accept that
a third option existed and had to suffer as a result.  When I eventually
did open myself to the truth, I made radical changes and went to great
lengths to bring about the necessary change.  I did not become more
popular, more rich, more whatever-the-social-metric-of-success is: I
simply found peace.  What happened to all those social points?  I don't
care: they are irrelevant.

To me this says that the process is harming you.  I already hinted at
what I did but let me be crystal clear: I quit.  Whether you should do
the same is for you to decide.

I will close with a brief comment on the sense of worthlessness.

When things don't go our way, we lose sight of the bigger picture.  We
develop tunnel vision as we focus our energy on pursuing that goal we
originally set out to accomplish.  We consider it a matter of pride or,
else, we develop a sense of duty to the cause.  Our real concern is what
the others may think: the family, the colleagues, the friends...  What
will they say if we fail?  We dread the prospect of failure.  It
unsettles us.  The idea that there are some imaginary judges out there
who will condemn us to an eternity of suffering and stigmatisation is
haunting us.  We thus get trapped in a loop of trying to be the hero in
someone else's story.  When we inevitably fail to meet those lofty
standards, we rationalise our condition as one of inadequacy: we say
that we are not good enough.  Instead of remaining open to the truth,
such as the possibility of a genuine alternative, we dwell on our
current condition.  We think we are worthless, when we simply lack
perspective.  Remove the tunnel vision and suddenly a new horizon opens
up.

Don't victimise yourself.  Don't punish yourself.

> I'd appreciate your thoughts and advice.

These are just the thoughts of a fellow traveller: I don't have
definitive answers.  I learn through trial and error.
