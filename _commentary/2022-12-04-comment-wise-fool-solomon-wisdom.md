Interpreting the Bible involves an understanding of its wider context.
My comment here is on this statement alone.

Reading your favourite translation and the ones in the link, I gather
these points:

* A wise person does not need to show off their wisdom.
* Fools cannot understand a wise person, due to that person's subtlety.
* To a fool, wisdom must be shown in order to be recognised.

I think here it is important to draw a distinction between "wise" and
"smart".  The latter pertains to one's mental prowess, while the former
is a disposition.  One can be super smart yet unwise.  Just think about
all the otherwise brilliant minds who committed horrific acts.

Wisdom consists in recognising one's limits, in light of a broader
understanding of phenomena.  This means that the person tries to think
of things in terms of the relations between the applicable factors.  For
example, we find a homeless man.  The fool will be quick to remark how
drugs can ruin a man.  Whereas the wiser one will point out that we do
not really know what caused this man's homelessness and, perhaps, the
situation is of a systemic sort such as an economic crisis.

Understanding events in terms of the interplay of factors involves an
appreciation of how we think of relevance: which factors we consider
pertinent to the case and which ones we leave out.  In this example of
the homeless man, the fool thinks that the only relevant factor is the
man's free will and the self-destructive decisions he made in life.
Whereas the wiser person incorporates magnitudes that are beyond this
homeless man which, nonetheless, contribute to the man's actuality.

Notice that I described wisdom as a disposition.  The wise person is not
perfect.  All humans are imperfect: we all err.  The wise person simply
has the honesty to admit to their mistakes and, more generally, to
recognise that their humanity makes them fallible.  The fools,
especially the super smart ones, overestimate their abilities and end up
obstinately committing to questionable causes, such as the pursuit of
vanity projects.

The wise person thus remains open to the possibility of learning
something new, which includes the possibility of revising one's own
views.  As such, we have an attitude of not taking oneself too seriously
by always retaining a kernel of doubt.  We call this "dubitativeness".
The Greek-derived word is "aporetic".  It goes together with the quest
of learning and re-learning, which we call "inquisitiveness" ("zetetic"
for the Greek word).  To not take oneself too seriously in this way is
to be humble.  This links to the point of not showing off.

To me, the word "fool" does not mean "unintelligent".  It rather
describes a disposition of not thinking holistically.  The fool does not
try to understand the factors in their interplay and, generally, does
not maintain a consistently honest approach to all matters in life.
This is why fools do not recognise the limits of their humanity.  It is
also is why fools have a propensity of showing off, but also of not
perceiving subtlety.

The fool cannot discern that which is nuanced in a person because the
fool is too self-centred and thus thinks that everyone must also be
showing off what they have.  Why is the fool self-centred?  Because of
not trying to think holistically.  Fools will not recognise a wise
person in their midst.  Maybe they will understand that the person is
different, but they will not have the disposition qua fools to
appreciate what the person's wisdom entails.
