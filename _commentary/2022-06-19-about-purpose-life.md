I will answer your questions in a round-about way, starting with a
comment on your age.  You mention you are a teenager who already is a
programmer and is attending conferences.  To me this is inspiring.  It
shows you are serious in what you do, which is a positive sign as it
implies commitment and an eagerness to put in the requisite effort.
Without hard work, no amount of talent will ever be good enough.

By "inspiring" I don't mean to flatter you.  I am genuine about it.  As
a teenager I was all about having fun, play football, fool around with
my friends, take nothing seriously.  I gradually learnt to be more
focused by having to earn a living and pay for my life+university
expenses in my late teens to early 20s.  I figured things out through
trial and error, with "trial and error" being a defining feature of
everything I do to this day.

For you to show this quality at a young age is an indication that you
may be on the right path.  The right path to where?  We will get to
that.

The potential downside of being driven is that you are on a mission to
prove or achieve something.  It is okay to take things seriously, but
not too seriously.  When you overdo it, when you over-commit to a cause
you are necessarily fully invested in it; you are obsessed with it; you
cannot let go of it; you become it.

Every goal entails expectations.  These are ideas which influence our
conduct.  If, say, I set a target to write a 100 essays until the end of
the year, because I know I am capable of it and want to push myself, I
am already framing the experiences of the next months in light of this
ambition.  Every passing day revolves around this notion of working
towards the goal, moving in that direction, and making sacrifices in the
process.  For example, I might have to skip some emails, not go for a
walk, refrain from programming, and the like, all in the name of
essentially winning a bet with myself.

Being driven means that you are competitive.  There are two types of
competitors: those whose primary aim is to best others and those who
want to outdo themselves.  In both cases, there has to be a sense of
perspective in order not to go to extremes.  Because if you make it your
life's telos to win in that one single category, everything you do will
be instrumentalised towards this end as you turn yourself from a fully
fledged human being into the avatar of an ambition.

When you avatarise yourself, either by conscious choice or by
internalising the norms of your social milieu and believing to be acting
out of your own initiative, your purpose in life is to accomplish that
which rendered you manifest as an avatar.  The avatar that sets to write
a 100 essays until the end of the year lives and dies by that target.
The avatar who seeks to only make money is realised in the plenty and
made irrelevant in the few.

We often hear people lament how they are a failure in life.  To which I
must ask: are you a failure or some avatar of yours?  Did the human
being qua human being fail, or did the persona you made out of it not
win in its little game?  A persona which was designed in the image of a
certain bundle of expectations and in pursuit of a given idea.

Who is the failure, really?

There is a poem by a Greek poet called George Seferis (Γιώργος Σεφέρης)
which is titled [Helen
(Ελένη)](https://www.greek-language.gr/digitalResources/literature/tools/concordance/browse.html?cnd_id=1&text_id=3175).
It nominally is about Helen of Troy and, by extension, the Trojan War
and its aftermath.  As legend has it, the Achaeans fought the Trojans
because a prince from the latter camp seduced Helen who was in the
former's camp (simplifying in the interest of brevity).  A decade-long
war ensued.  In his poem, Seferis alludes to the beautiful island of
Cyprus and how the nightingales won't let you sleep at Platres (a
village close to where I live), while reflecting on this notion of
effectively winning in a game; a game that was fought in the pretext of
Helen.  What was it all for, Seferis concludes, but for "an empty shirt,
for a Helen".

Who is the Helen we all pursue by default?  Money, fame, glory, a
successful career, enjoying the validation of being recognised as a
genius, a hard-worker, and so on.  Much like the poet's empty shirt,
these too are fleeting dreams, devoid of any further meaning.  They have
value insofar as we give them value.  It is not intrinsic to them.

Just look at how unfortunate the world's uber-rich are.  They are
trapped in a gruelling game where they compete against each other and
the rest of the planet over who gets the best score, which is measured
by their net worth.  There is no tangible difference in your life if you
have 100 mansions instead of a 150: they still are more than you will
ever need.  But in the context of the game, where your avatar's utility
is measured by the number of mansions at its possession, every extra
piece matters greatly.  The uber-rich are unfortunate because they are
shallow in what they do and fail to realise it: a high score on the
richness index, nothing but an empty shirt.

Now we are back to the contents of your email.  I quote:

In its simplest form, philosophy is the practice of asking "why".
Consider it now but don't provide a definitive answer.  You are young
and likely have a lot to learn (just like I do through trial and error).
Why pursue fame?  Is it for the sake of being famous?  And what is the
point of that?  To show that you are better than your peers?  To be
potentially more attractive to better (define "better") sexual partners?
To be seen as the proud heir of your family's legacy?  And why even care
about legacy?

These are all social constructs that inform our cultural milieu.  We are
immersed in the culture before we even start to form our own opinions
and develop an independent way of thinking.  They are thus taken for
granted.  We want to accomplish those goals because our social life is
itself a role-playing game or, at least, starts out that way until we
assume agency.  You have to be the child prodigy, the studious student,
the eager and tireless labourer, the fair lady who is the object of
admiration (emphasis on "object") but otherwise has no personality, the
alpha male because reducing yourself to a caricature of a sociopath is
supposed to be cool now, and so on.  There are all these roles and each
of them engenders the same kind of avatarisation I already outlined.

This contradicts nicely with the previous quote.  At least there is a
kernel there, a core idea that maybe---just maybe---what others have and
what you lack is worthwhile only in light of a given perspective.  As
soon as you view it from a different angle, it becomes worthless.

This statement of yours shows that you already know the difference
between fame for its own sake and fame as a by-product of some other
activity.  I think the fact you don't want the former already puts you
in a position to not partake in the given role-playing game.  What about
the latter?  What about fame as a side-effect or bonus?  You need to be
careful with it.  Make sure not to turn it into a tacit objective, as it
will also instrumentalise everything else in your life, even if you
don't admit to it.

With those granted, we are ready to answer your questions:

> [...] almost everyone seem to talk about some purpose in life and none

> purpose in their life? How to realise god and fulfill my duties of
> life?

Maybe no-one elaborates because theirs is a cliché with no further
meaning?  If the purpose in life is something we define, then how can we
be sure we made the right choice?  Which version of myself is best
suited to decide on this all-important matter?  The pre-teen me who does
what the parents want?  The impressionable, inexperienced, and reckless
adolescent me who pretends to know everything but actually is a fool?
The young adult me who lives a stressful life in pursuit of a succesful
career and who thus has developed tunnel vision?  The current me who has
more questions than answers?  If the purpose in life is meant to be
given by me, I am none the wiser as there is no singular "me" devoid of
context.

Let us then return to metaphors.  The ancient Greek creators had a
tradition of appealing to the muses (goddesses of arts and science).
Statements like "sing to me, oh Muse, so that I may talk about THIS and
THAT".  Who does a muse sing to?  Can I, for example, who am terrible in
music, painting, and poetry, refashion myself as an artist?  No.  The
muse picks the person in advance and we only ever learn about the muse's
doings through that person.

If my purpose in life were decided solely by me, then there is a chance
I would be led to make the mistake of putting all my energy towards
becoming that which I cannot be or am unsuitable for.  Each of us has a
unique set of features.  Each is predisposed towards certain fields of
endeavour and sees a unique horizon of possibilities per the particulars
of the case.

By recognising that not everything we do is subject to---or emanates
from---our own volition, we emancipate ourselves from the burden of a
terrible falsehood: the misunderstanding that if we do not achieve
something, we are the only ones to blame for and must see ourselves as a
failure due to it.

In a sense, there is no purpose in life.  Even if the muse talks to you,
you might misinterpret what she is saying or, generally, put a different
spin on it.  Your works will be your own, not the muse's.  And because
there is no immutable selfhood, your interpretations will change and
evolve.  If you are fixated on a singular purpose, you foreshadow and
inhibit this natural process with a peculiar dogma of constancy.  Admit
to being a variable.

Continuing with the metaphor...  In another sense, your purpose in life
is to find the goddess that speaks to you.  There are lots of deities
and not all are about the arts.  Try to take a step back from what your
family, friends, culture wants and start being honest about what you
want; about what your condition predisposes you towards.  By being true
to yourself, you let the god's signal cut through all the noise that
society creates.  You will then know to aim for a betterment of what the
god has given you, with the understanding that your humanity renders you
subject to change; your presence in the world necessarily contextualises
you and makes you a function of an interplay of factors outside your
control.

What I have learnt is to not take myself too seriously.  I am not
emotionally invested in what I do, I am eager to admit my mistakes, and
will not fight for my ideas because that presumes I am right.  I shall
not wage war for "an empty shirt, for a Helen".

My purpose in life then, if I can put it this way, is to pursue the
truth, which includes the possibility that there may be no absolute
truth to be attained.  So I am relaxed and have no worry if I don't
discover anything and don't go anywhere.  There is a lightness to it.  A
purpose that has no real purpose.

In conclusion, you are young and you will have plenty of time to find
the answers or ask the questions.  Do not make the mistake of letting
your adolescent you dictate the life of your adult you.  Remain
open-minded and allow space for flexibility.
