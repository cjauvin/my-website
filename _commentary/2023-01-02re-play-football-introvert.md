The following is an excerpt from a recent exchange.  I am asked about
this both because I am introvert and was a football player for many
years in a semi-professional capacity.  The identity of my
correspondent remains a secret and this information is shared with
their permission.

I will answer your questions.  I think your initiative is wonderful and
will make you feel better once you get into the flow.  Can I publish my
response on my website?  I want to include the above quote for context.
I will not disclose your contact details.  Is this okay?

Let's start with the "shy guy" part.  The footballer who is the greatest
of his era and arguably the greatest of all time, Lionel Messi, is a shy
guy.  You can find lots of stories about this.  Basically, the other
kids were wondering if Messi could actually talk, as he was always so
reserved when he was younger.

In sport what matters is one's ability.  If you put in the effort, if
you show that you care, then people will acknowledge it and respect you
for it.  To be a sportsperson in earnest, then, is to treat people based
on what they do that is relevant to the task, not how they look, not
what their connections are, not how colourful their personality is.  So
do not worry about being shy or an introvert (those are not the same, by
the way): they are not relevant to playing the game.

Your personality will matter for interpersonal dynamics.  Football is a
team game and if you are not a team player, you have no place there.
"Team player" is a matter of disposition: you win and lose as a team;
you do not blame others; you are generous and kind.  Don't worry about
making friends or being talkative.  When you do the various exercises,
you will often be paired with someone else.  Even if you are super shy,
you will still be interacting with another person.  The more drills you
do, the more social you will be.  Just be relaxed about it.

Sport teaches you to be honest from day one.  You cannot fake skill.
You cannot pretend that you have the build to run 90 minutes up and down
the pitch.  You cannot boast about passing the ball with accuracy or
shooting it with pace on target because your first kick will already
show what you can actually do.  Sport keeps you in check.  Embrace the
ethos of the game and learn to always be a sportsperson: be honest about
your qualities and have the kindness to recognise another's ability.

In practical terms, honesty means that you will show up at your team's
training ground and ask to talk to the coach.  You are an absolute
beginner, so tell the coach exactly that.  Ask if you can train with the
team.  Because you are a beginner, you have no high expectations of
being an instrumental player on the field from the beginning.  No, you
want to take it slow in order to learn the fundamentals and to improve
your fitness in the process.

Furthermore, honesty means that you will always be in the mindset of
learning by doing.  You will not be afraid to, say, kick the ball
poorly.  Nobody has those skills from the start: they are acquired
through continuous practice.  Do not worry about failing or looking
awkward: that's all part of the process.  Be attentive to what the coach
is showing you and observe how your teammates are doing it.  Be in the
mindset of learning and do not pretend to know stuff---again, be honest.

This brings me to the point about young kids beating you.  Here is a
story from when I was ~15.  I was allowed to train with the adults.
They were much bigger than me.  But I was tenacious.  We were playing an
11-a-side session.  The defensive midfielder of the other team tried to
joke around that I would not survive on the pitch.  I told him not to
worry as I would kick his ass.  It was all friendly banter between team
mates: I survived just fine and did keep my promise.  The gist of the
story is that "young kids" still have footballing ability; ability that
you simply lack right now.  They also probably are more fit than you.
So expect to be beaten time and time again.  That's okay as you are a
beginner.

There is no shame in losing.  You try your best and you do it in honour.
Remember the part about sportspersonship: recognise another's ability.
The only thing that is shameful is cheating.  You want to be honest and
thus you will not cheat.  Don't worry about the rest.

You mention being overwhelmed.  My opinion is that you are overthinking
it as an outsider.  When you actually start running, your body requires
all the energy it can get.  This simply means that the mind is focused
on the here-and-now and does not have the luxury to entertain scenaria.
The cycle of overthinking is broken by action.  Just go out there and
start playing.  You will feel liberated when you are in that state of
being where you control your actions while your mind is not placing
any obstacles along your path.

About me teaching you, I should clarify here that I was not a
professional.  I was a "semi-professional".  This means that I was
training the way a professional does, I enjoyed some perks that were
provided by the club, but had not yet signed an employment contract.  I
would have done that, were it not for an untimely injury that changed my
life.  It does not matter though, as I always was knowledgeable of the
game and have thought about it for long.

The distillation of my experience is that you do not learn sport
theoretically.  No book or seminar will help you get started.  What it
will do instead is reinforce your propensity to overthink, to the point
where it will prevent you from acting.  The best advice I can give you
is to muster the courage to find the team's coach and ask to talk about
who you are and what you want.  Explain that you are a rookie, that you
know what to expect, and that you want to gradually learn and improve.

Theoretical knowledge of football is for those who already are at a
higher level in terms of practical skills.  You will need to have a good
grasp of tactics, formations, time and space on the pitch only when you
become more skilful or if you want to be a coach.  This is not where you
are now, so forget about it.  Simply focus on the here-and-now which
starts with your initial contact with the coach and your first training
sessions.

The kids will beat you.  Do not take it personally.  The kids may make
fun of you for not being a skilful player.  Again, do not take it
personally.  Use it as motivation to try harder.  Don't talk big: train
for the day when you prove them wrong and they will not make fun of you
anymore.  This helps you build up your resolve.  You will feel stronger
and more confident.

Know that a good leader is one who can first impose control over their
own self.  Lead by example, not authority or intimidation, and others
will recognise what you are doing.

Ultimately, understand that this is a game.  Sport has a lot of life
lessons to teach us, as I have already hinted.  Perhaps the most
enduring of them all is to take it easy: it is a game, after all.
