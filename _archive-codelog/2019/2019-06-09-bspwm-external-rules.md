In this screen cast I show how my external rules script informs the
window manager about the behaviour of receptacles and preselections.
These are some advanced features of BSPWM for controlling the placement
of windows.  The scripted method is complementary to the operations
I demonstrated in my previous video: [Advanced manual tiling in
BSPWM](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-06-07-bspwm-receptacles/)

As with the rest of the session, the external rules script is part of
[my dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles).
