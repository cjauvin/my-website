In this video I talk about [my fork of
lemonbar](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/lemonbar-xft) that has support
for the `fontconfig` library.

What I discuss here has been documented in my last two coding blog
(codelog) entries:

1. [Compile Lemonbar Xft on Debian 10 Buster](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-06-23-lemonbar-xft-new/).
2. [How I forked lemonbar-xft](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-06-24-lemonbar-xft-howto/).
