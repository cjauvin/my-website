In this screen cast, I offer an introduction to GNU Stow.  Its manpage
describes it as a "software package installation manager".

I personally use `stow` to exercise centralised control over sets of
custom configuration files.  It makes things considerably easier,
especially when working with complex directory structures, such as
those found in [my dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles).

In the video I also make reference to my latest book, "[Prot's Dots
For Debian](https://protesilaos.com/pdfd)" (PDFD) which contains a
section on how to use GNU Stow for the purposes of reproducing my
custom desktop session.
