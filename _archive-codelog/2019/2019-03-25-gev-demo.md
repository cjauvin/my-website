In this screen cast I showcase my latest script, called "Git's Eye
View", else GEV.  This is a simple script I wrote for getting an
overview of the status of all git-controlled repositories inside a given
directory.

When running `gev`, a two-column list is drawn, with the status code on
the left and the file system path of the git-controlled repo on the
right.  The status codes are:

* 0 == no changes
* 1 == unstaged changes
* 2 == staged, but not committed
* 3 == untracked files

GEV is part of [my dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles).
Within the next month or so, I will publish a book on how to reproduce
my custom desktop session on Debian 10 Buster. An announcement will be
made in the [news section](https://protesilaos.com/news/).  The book will be available in the
[books section](https://protesilaos.com/books/) under the same copyleft terms as all my work on
this website.
