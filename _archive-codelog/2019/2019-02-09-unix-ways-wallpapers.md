In this screen cast I demonstrate three scripts I have developed for
setting my custom desktop session's wallpaper.

* `sbg` is a CLI tool that accepts the path to a single image file as an
  argument.  All it does is set that file as the new wallpaper.
* `sbgmenu` is a `dmenu` interface with two modes: (i) viewing images,
  (ii) setting a wallpaper.  Everything is still text-based.
* `nbm` follows a graphical approach.  It presents an image grid where
  the user can enlarge an image and mark the one intended as the new
  wallpaper.

All scripts as well as the entire desktop session are part of [my
dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles).
