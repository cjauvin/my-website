In this video I talk at length about the official release of [Prot's
Dots For Debian](https://protesilaos.com/pdfd) (PDFD) and the code base
it deals with.  This is a free/libre book that allows you to reproduce
my custom desktop session, while offering detailed information on the
various facets of my setup.

Consider this a primer on my BSPWM.  By watching it, you should have
a general idea of what is going and how the various programs are put
together.  I cover everything from the basics to some advanced topics.
I also offer a short guide on Tmux, the terminal multiplexer that is an
integral part of my daily workflow.

Kindly note that Debian 10 'Buster' officially releases on July 6, 2019
(today is July 2, 2019).  I have decided to publish my work slightly in
advance to make sure that everything works as expected.  If you are
eager to follow the steps in PDFD, please wait just a little bit longer.
