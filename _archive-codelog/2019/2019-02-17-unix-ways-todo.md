In this screen cast I demonstrate my methodology for writing tasks, as
well as a couple of scripts for interacting with the to-do list.

* `stm` is a CLI tool that provides various ways of presenting the
  pending tasks, using standard UNIX utilities.
* `stmmenu` is a `dmenu` interface that either removes a matching string
  from the list, or appends a non-matching item to the list.

All scripts as well as the entire desktop session are part of [my
dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles).
