excerpt: 'Documenting the reasoning and steps I followed to prepare my soft fork of ST: the Simple Terminal by the Suckless community.'

The Suckless community recently announced the release of
[st-0.8.2](https://st.suckless.org/).  Seeing as I maintain [a soft
fork](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/st), it was time to refactor my
repo.  I took this opportunity to also review my build, which led me to
the realisation that I need no added features whatsoever.  The generic
terminal emulator is good enough.

## What my fork is about

In terms of functionality, I build `st` in the user's home directory.
This is how I have designed my custom desktop session (distributed via
[my dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles)): there is
`$HOME/bin` which is added to `$PATH`.

As for aesthetics:

* I have modified the font definition to leverage my `fonts.conf`
  settings in order to use my custom typefaces (see my dotfiles).
* All options related to colours are sourced from another file via an
  `#include` directive.  This allows me to (i) add my [Tempus
  themes](https://protesilaos.com/tempus-themes/) and (ii) control ST's appearance through
  scripts that are part of my custom desktop session (where I perform
  live theme switches across the entire environment).

Here are a couple of video demonstrations:

* Basics of [my BSPWM session](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2018-12-27-bspwm-demo-video/).
* Using [ST and TMUX with BSPWM](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-01-13-tmux-demo-bspwm/).

## How I prepared my fork

Downloaded the latest release tarball and extracted it in place:

	tar xf st-0.8.2.tar.gz

I made two copies of the decompressed directory.  The one served as
a reference point, while the other was used to apply my modifications.

Once I was done altering the source code, I did:

	diff -up ~/st-0.8.2-upstream ~/st-0.8.2-prot-soft-fork/ > \
	st-protesilaos-stavrou-soft-fork-0.8.2.diff

The generated `.diff` could then be applied to the upstream code base
with the following:

	patch path/to/st-protesilaos-stavrou-soft-fork-0.8.2.diff

## Review and refactor

After applying my changes, I decided to review my use of upstream
patches, such as the one offering clipboard support, or the other that
improves the appearance of box-drawing characters.

All of them have been removed from my fork in the interest of long-term
maintainability.  It is difficult to guarantee that such features will
work with new upstream releases.  Plus their functionality is
inessential to my workflowâ€¦ Learn to work with less!

To use [my] `st-0.8.2` on Debian Buster we need:

	sudo apt install libx11-dev libxft-dev libxext-dev libfreetype6-dev pkgconf

Simplifying things makes my life easier.  It is now trivial to maintain my
fork, which is an integral part of my custom desktop session.
