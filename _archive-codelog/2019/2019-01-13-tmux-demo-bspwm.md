In this screen cast I demonstrate the basics of TMUX, the terminal
multiplexer.  I discuss why I think this is a very powerful tool to
master and why I do not see any real overlap between it and a tiling
window manager (such as BSPWM).

I use TMUX daily and consider it essential to my workflow.  The theme
and other configurations on display are part of [my
dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles).
