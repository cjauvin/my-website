In this screen cast, I present a working prototype of TMR (_TMR Must
Recur_).  This is a shell script written in Bash that implements
a simplistic timer.  `tmr` is meant to be executed in the console and
accepts a single argument that must be a valid unit of time, such as
`10s` for ten seconds.

The purpose of this script is mostly didactic.  It tries to do things by
using Bash parameter expansion.  Ultimately, this is just an experiment
meant to explore the possibilities of various shell scripting methods.

TMR is part of [my dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles)
and is licensed under the GPLv3 (as is the rest of the code).
