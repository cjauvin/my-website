In this screen cast, I present a new script I wrote that compares the
contrast ratio between two colours.  The script is called CLR
(conveniently pronounced as "colour"), which stands for "Check
Luminance Ratio".

The code of CLR makes heavy of Bash parameter expansion.  It helps me
practice some of my shell scripting skills.

In the screen cast I also offer a primer on colours in the RGB space and
talk a little bit about accessibility.

CLR is part of [my dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles)
and is licensed under the GPLv3 (as is the rest of the code).
