In this screen cast, I offer an overview of SXHKD, the "Simple X Hotkey
Daemon".  This is a program that stores custom key bindings.  We use it
to control the window manager, as well as launch other arbitrary
processes

I use `sxhkd` in tandem with my tiling window manager: `bspwm`.  These
two programs have been developed by the same person: Bastien Dejean.

The demo is based on the configurations that are bundled with the rest
of [my dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles).
