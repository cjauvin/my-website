This screen cast is a demonstration of my shell script that implements
dynamic desktop creation/removal in the Binary Space Partitioning Window
Manager.  It is a feature that runs contrary to the upstream default of
setting a fixed number of desktops.

This script and all other parts of the demo are distributed with [my
dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles).
