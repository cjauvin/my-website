In this screen cast I demonstrate the basics of BSPWM (Binary Space
Partitioning Window Manager).  This is a tiling window manager that
I use on my Debian GNU/Linux machine.  It is an integral part of my
custom desktop session.

For the underlying code base, refer to [my
dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles).  The more
adventurous among you can also have a look at an older article of mine
on [how to get my setup on Debian
Sid](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/how-to-bspwm-debian-sid/) (though this will not give you
the most up-to-date version of my dotfilesâ€”I intend to have a new guide
in time for Debian 10).
